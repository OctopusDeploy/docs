# react-hotkeys-hook
React hook for using keyboard shortcuts in components.
This is a hook version for the [hotkeys] package.

### Documentation and live example

https://johannesklauss.github.io/react-hotkeys-hook/

### Installation

```shell
npm install react-hotkeys-hook
```

or

```shell
yarn add react-hotkeys-hook
```

Make sure that you have at least version 16.8 of `react` and `react-dom` installed, or otherwise hooks won't work for you.

### Usage
```js
export const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1));
    
  return (
    <p>
      Pressed {count} times.
    </p>
  );
};
```

The hook takes care of all the binding and unbinding for you.
As soon as the component mounts into the DOM, the key stroke will be
listened to. When the component unmounts it will stop listening.

### Call Signature

```typescript
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void, options: Options = {}, deps: any[] = [])
```

The callback function takes the exact parameters as the callback function in the hotkeys package.
See [hotkeys] documentation for more info or look into the typings file.

### Parameters
- `keys: string`: Here you can set the key strokes you want the hook to listen to. You can use single or multiple keys,
modifier combination, etc. See [this](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#defining-shortcuts)
section on the hotkeys documentation for more info.
- `callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void`: Gets executed when the defined keystroke
gets hit by the user. **Important:** Since version 1.5.0 this callback gets memoised inside the hook. So you don't have
to do this anymore by yourself.
- `options: Options = {}`
  - `filter: (event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` is used to enable hotkeys inside input elements. Check out [hotkeys docs](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#filter) for usage. Due to constraints with the base library, `filter` is a global setting. As a result, it is currently not possible to have different filters for separate calls of `useHotkey`.
  - * `enableOnTags: string[]` is used to enable listening to hotkeys in form fields. Available values are `INPUT`, `TEXTAREA` and `SELECT`. **IMPORTANT!** When you provide a custom `filter` implementation function this parameter will be ignored. Similar to `filter`, setting this option will enable it globally.
  - `splitKey: string` is used to change the splitting character inside the keys argument. Default is `+`, but if you want
    to listen to the `+` character, you can set `splitKey` to i.e. `-` and listen for `ctrl-+`
  - `keyup: boolean` Determine if you want to listen on the keyup event
  - `keydown: boolean` Determine if want to listen on the keydown event
- `deps: any[] = []`: The dependency array that gets appended to the memoisation of the callback. Here you define the inner
dependencies of your callback. If for example your callback actions depend on a referentially unstable value or a value
that will change over time, you should add this value to your deps array. Since most of the time your callback won't
depend on any unstable callbacks or changing values over time you can leave this value alone since it will be set to an
empty array by default. See the [Memoisation](#memoisation) section to
learn more and see an example where you have to set this array.

### `useIsHotkeyPressed` hook

The `useIsHotkeyPressed` hook just returns the `hotkeys.isPressed` function and works exactly the same.

```ts
const isPressed = useIsHotkeyPressed();

isPressed('return'); // Returns true if Return key is pressed down.
```

### Local Development

Checkout this repo, run `yarn` or `npm i` and then run the `docz:dev` script.
You can use the `docs/useHotkeys.mdx` to test the behavior of the hook. It directly imports the
`src/index.ts` file and transpiles it automatically. So you don't have to worry about. For more info
on .mdx files, check out the docz documentation: https://www.docz.site/docs/writing-mdx
