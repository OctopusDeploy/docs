[Getting Started - Create Environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPb6CLHyNLA)

Octopus organizes the servers and services where you deploy your software into environments. Typical environments are **Dev**, **Test**, and **Production**, and they represent the stages of your deployment pipeline.

1. To create an environment, in the Octopus Web Portal, navigate to **{{Infrastructure,Environments}}** and click **ADD ENVIRONMENT**.
1. Give your new environment a meaningful name, for instance, *Test*, and click **SAVE**.

You now have your first environment.
