As your usage of Octopus grows, and you start to have many environments and many projects, *project groups* can be a useful way to organize your Octopus Deploy installation.


A project group contains a list of projects. It also groups the projects together on the dashboard.

## Creating project groups {#ProjectGroups-Creatingprojectgroups}


Project groups can be added from the projects tab, using the **Add project group** link.
