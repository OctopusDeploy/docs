:::problem
**Azure VM Extension not currently available via the Azure Portal**
The Octopus Tentacle VM extension is temporarily unavailable from the Azure Portal. We are working with Microsoft to rectify this and you can watch [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/2859) to be notified of progress. In the meantime, you can install the extension [via the Azure CLI](via-the-azure-cli.md) or [via PowerShell](via-powershell.md).

<!--
:::hint
If you need the ability to customize more of the installation, the [CLI](via-the-azure-cli.md), [PowerShell](via-powershell.md) and [ARM Template](via-an-arm-template.md) methods expose more options than the Azure Portal. For even more customization, you might want to consider using the [Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-extensions-dsc-overview) in conjunction with the [OctopusDSC](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/OctopusDSC) resource.
