Installing Octopus Deploy involves three main steps:

1. Install the central [Octopus Deploy Server](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/index.md).
2. Install the [Tentacle Deployment Agent](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/index.md) on any machine you plan to deploy software to.
3. Decide [where to store your packages](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md).

## Upgrading {#Installation-Upgrading}

If Octopus is already installed, and you want to upgrade to a new version, please follow the steps in the [upgrade guide](/docs/administration/upgrading/index.md).
