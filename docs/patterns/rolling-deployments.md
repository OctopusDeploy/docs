description: Implementing rolling deployments, i.e. deploying to release to servers one-by-one, with Octopus.

Rolling deployments are a pattern whereby, instead of deploying a package to all servers at once, we slowly roll out the release by deploying it to each server one-by-one. In load balanced scenarios, this allows us to reduce overall downtime.

Normally, when executing a deployment process with multiple steps, Octopus runs all of the steps **sequentially**; it waits for the first step to finish before starting the second, and so on.

NuGet package steps and [PowerShell steps](/docs/deploying-applications/custom-scripts/index.md), however, target roles, which may contain multiple deployment targets. When a single step targets multiple machines, the step is run on those machines **in parallel**. So to recap:

- Deployment steps are run in sequence
- The actions performed by each step are performed in parallel on all deployment targets

However, sometimes this isn't desired. If you are deploying to a farm of 10 web servers, it might be nice to deploy to one machine at a time, or to batches of machines at a time. This is called a **rolling deployment**.

## Configuring a rolling deployment {#Rollingdeployments-Configuringarollingdeployment}

Rolling deployments can be configured on a PowerShell or NuGet package step by clicking **Configure a rolling deployment**.

When configuring a rolling deployment, you specify a **window size**.

The window size controls how many deployment targets can be deployed to at once.

- A window size of 1 will deploy to a single deployment target at a time. Octopus will wait for the step to finish running on deployment target A before starting on deployment target B
- A window size of 3 will deploy to a three deployment targets at a time. Octopus will wait for the step to finish running on deployment targets A, B *or* C before starting on deployment target D

## Child steps {#Rollingdeployments-Childsteps}

Rolling deployments allow you to wait for a step to finish on one deployment target before starting the step on the next deployment target. But what if you need to perform a series of steps on one target, before starting that series of steps on the next target? To support this, Octopus allows you to create **Child Steps**.

First, open the menu for an existing step, and click **Add Child Step**.

Octopus has numerous steps that support rolling deployments depending on your install version including:

- Deploy to IIS step
- Deploy a Windows Service step
- Deploy a package step
- Run a Script
- Send an Email step
- Manual intervention required step
- Run an Azure PowerShell Script step
- Deploy an Azure Resource Group step
- Run a Service Fabric SDK PowerShell Script step

After adding a child step, the deployment process will now show the step as containing multiple actions:

You can edit the parent step to change the roles that the steps run on or the window size.

With this configuration, we run the entire website deployment step - taking the machine out of the load balancer, deploying the site, and returning it to the load balancer - on each machine in sequence as part of a rolling deployment step.

This five minute video (with captions) will guide you through setting up a rolling deployment with child steps.
