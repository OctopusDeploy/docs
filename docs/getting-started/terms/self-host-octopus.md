Octopus Deploy can be installed as a self-hosted instance. The self-hosted version is available as either a fast lane release that includes the latest features, or a stable long-term support (LTS) version that comes with six months support. Installing self-hosted instance sets up the Octopus Web Portal and the Octopus Rest API.

Learn how to install self-host Octopus Deploy from the [installation documentation](/docs/installation/index.md).
