Control Center is where you manage your Octopus subscriptions and their associated user access. 

There are 2 types of Octopus subscriptions:

1. **Cloud instances**: Deployments-as-a-service
2. **Server licenses**: Octopus on your infrastructure

This page focuses on Control Center V2, our new system for managing Octopus subscriptions.

## Control Center V1 and V2 

### Explaining the two versions of Control Center

In October 2022, we moved to Stripe as our payment gateway, so we needed a new system for integration with Stripe. We refer to the new system as Control Center V2, and it will replace Control Center later this year. During 2023, we'll migrate your subscriptions from V1 to V2 as you pay or renew. After the migration is complete, we'll deprecate V1.

### I can’t work out how to do something in Control Center V2 that I used to do in V1

There are some Control Center V1 features that we haven’t included in V2 yet. This is only temporary while we gain feature-parity for Control Center V2.

If you can’t see how to do something in V2 that you could do in V1, please email [support@octopus.com](mailto:support@octopus.com) for assistance. 

### Locating subscriptions

All your subscriptions (Cloud instances and Server licenses) are accessible from Control Center V1. Only subscriptions we've migrated to Control Center V2 are accessible from V2.

### Migration of subscriptions

Trial subscriptions are created in Control Center V1. Subscriptions in Control Center V1 migrate to V2 when you change to a paid subscription or a yearly renewal. This is why you may have some subscriptions in Control Center V1 and others in V2 until they're all transferred to V2.

## Access control

### Understanding access control

There are 2 levels of access you can provide users in Control Center. Each level has associated user roles.

1. **Subscription Group access** provides management of a group of subscriptions plus access to all current and future subscriptions in the group. 
2. **Direct access** provides access to individual subscriptions.

### Subscription Group access

Below are the roles for Subscription Group access, the permissions they provide for the group, and the subscriptions in the group:
