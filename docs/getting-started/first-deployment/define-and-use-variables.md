Octopus allows you to define variables and scope them for use in different phases of your deployments.  Variables allow you to have a consistent deployment process across your infrastructure without having to hard-code or manually update configuration settings that differ across environments, deployment targets, channels, or tenants.

1. From the *Hello world* project you created earlier, click **Variables** in the left menu.
1. Enter **Helloworld.Greeting** into the variable name column on the first row of the table.
1. Add **Hello, Development** into the value column.
1. Click the **Scope** column and select the `Development` environment.
1. Click **ADD ANOTHER VALUE** button.
1. Add **Hello, Test** and scope it to the `Test` environment.
1. Click **ADD ANOTHER VALUE** button.
1. Add **Hello, Production** and scope it to the `Production` environment.
1. Click the **SAVE** button.

Steps in the deployment process can reference the variables.

1. Click Process on the left menu.
1. Select the previously created Run a Script step.
1. Replace the inline source code script based on your selected language:

```powershell PowerShell
Write-Host $OctopusParameters["Helloworld.Greeting"]
```
```bash Bash
greeting=$(get_octopusvariable "Helloworld.Greeting")
echo $greeting
```

:::hint
If you are using Octopus Cloud, Bash scripts require you to select the **Hosted Ubuntu** worker pool.  The **Default Worker Pool** is running Windows and doesn't have Bash installed.
:::

4. Click the **SAVE** button and create a new release.

:::hint
A release snapshots everything about your project, including variables and the deployment process. You have to create a new release to see any changes.
:::

As you promote through the environments, you will see the greeting change.

The next step will [add an approval process using manual interventions](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/approvals-with-manual-interventions.md).
