This tutorial will help you complete your first deployment in Octopus Deploy.  It will walk through the steps to deploy a sample [hello world package](https://octopus.com/images/docs/hello-world.1.0.0.zip) to one or more of your servers.  The only prerequisite is a running Octopus Deploy instance, either in Octopus Cloud or self-hosted.  The tutorial assumes you have a brand new instance running and will walk through the rest of the setup, including configuring deployment targets.

This tutorial will take between **25-35 minutes** to complete, with each step taking between **2-5** minutes to complete.
