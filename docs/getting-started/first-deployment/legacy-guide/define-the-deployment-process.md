The deployment process is the steps the Octopus Server orchestrates to deploy your software. For our simple hello world script, we will only have one step.

![The Hello world deployment process](images/deployment-process.png "width=500")

1. From the *Hello world* project you created on the previous page, click **DEFINE YOUR DEPLOYMENT PROCESS**.
1. Click **ADD STEP**.
1. Select the **Script** tile to filter the types of steps.
1. Scroll down and click **ADD** on the **Run a Script** tile.
1. Accept the default name for the script and leave the **Enabled** check-box ticked.
1. In the **Execution Location** section, select **Run once on a worker** (if you are on self-hosted Octopus, select **Run once on the Octopus Server**).  If you are using Octopus Cloud and want to use Bash scripts change the worker pool from **Default Worker Pool** to **Hosted Ubuntu**.
1. Scroll down to the **Script**, select your script language of choice, and enter the following script in the **Inline Source Code** section:

```powershell PowerShell
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```
```bash Bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

:::hint
If you are using Octopus Cloud, Bash scripts require you to select the **Hosted Ubuntu** worker pool.  The **Default Worker Pool** is running Windows and doesn't have Bash installed.
:::

8. Click **SAVE**.

The next step will [create a release and deploy it](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/legacy-guide/create-and-deploy-a-release.md).
