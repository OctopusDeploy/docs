Many deployment samples in our docs reference our Octopus Cloud [samples instance](https://samples.octopus.app), which contains real-world deployment and runbook examples. Each one highlights one or more available Octopus features, from deploying Java applications to upgrading a Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster.

This page acts as a directory of features found in our samples instance.

:::hint
We're constantly adding to our samples instance. If you'd like to explore any of our samples further, just go to [https://samples.octopus.app](https://samples.octopus.app) and log in as a guest.
