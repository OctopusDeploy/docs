The following options are required when exporting a project.

**project export options**

```powershell

--name				Name of the project to export

```

Usage:

```powershell
octo export --server=http://octopusdeploy/api --apiKey=ABCDEF123456 --type=project --name=ProjectName --filePath=C:\path\to\export\file.json
```

### Project export output {#Export-ProjectExportOutput}

```powershell
Octopus Deploy Command Line Tool, version 1.0.0.0

Handshaking with Octopus Server: http://localhost/Octopus
Handshake successful. Octopus version: 2.4.4.43; API version: 3.0.0

Export file C:\tmp\OctoFX_Rate_Service.json successfully created.
```

### Project export file format {#Export-ProjectExportFileFormat}

```json
{
  // This contains the basic settings for the project you have exported.
  // If the project already exists on your other Octopus Server, then it will be updated with the new settings from the exported project.
  "Project": {
    ...
  },
 
  // This is used as a reference when importing to ensure that the same project group exists on your other Octopus Server.
  // If it doesn't already exist, you will need to create it.
  "ProjectGroup": {
    ...
  },
 
  // This contains the variables that have been created for the exported project.
  // If the project already existed and has variables set, these will be replaced with the variables from the project that is being imported.
  // Sensitive variable values will NOT be imported.
  "VariableSet": {
    ...
  },
 
  // This is used as a reference when importing to ensure that the same NuGet feed exists on your 
  // target Octopus Server.
  "NuGetFeeds": [
    ...
  ],
 
  // This contains the deployment process for the exported project.
  // If the project already existed and had a deployment process setup, this will be replaced with 
  // the deployment process from the project that is being imported.
  "DeploymentProcess": {
    ...
  },
 
  // This contains any library variable sets that are used by the project.
  // These are included as a reference when importing to ensure that the same 
  // Library Variable Set exists on your other Octopus Server.
  "LibraryVariableSets": [
    ...
  ],
 
  // Metadata about the export: when it was exported, what version of Octopus was used, etc.
  "$Meta": {
    ...
  }
}
```

:::warning
**Sensitive variable values will not be imported**
When the project variables contain values marked 'sensitive', their values will not be exported. The variable will be created with an empty value, and you can then modify the variables manually, typing in the new sensitive values once you have imported the project. If the variable already exists on a re-import and has a value, the value will be kept.
