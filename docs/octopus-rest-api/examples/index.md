As you work with the Octopus API, you may need some guidance on how to perform actions or what parameters to provide. The [OctopusDeploy-API GitHub repository](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy-Api) has many examples using the API. Our plan is to migrate those examples to this site and provide solutions for PowerShell with REST requests, PowerShell using Octopus.Client, and C# using Octopus.Client.
