## Description

This script is a starter for bootstrapping a new [Space](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md) in your Octopus instance.

It creates a new space with the provided name, description, and managers. At least one manager team or member must be provided.

Then the script will create the [Environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md) provided in the newly created space.

## Usage

Provide values for `Octopus URL`, `Octopus API Key`, `Space Name`, `Environments`, and a combination of `Manager Teams` and `Manager Team Members` to create a space with the provided names and environments.

## Scripts

!include <add-a-space-with-environments-scripts>
