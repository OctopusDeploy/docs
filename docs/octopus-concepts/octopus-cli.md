**octo** is a command line tool that interacts with the Octopus Deploy REST API. With the Octopus CLI you can package your applications for deployment as either Zip or NuGet packages, and manage your environments, deployments, channels, projects, and workers.

We recommend installing the Octopus CLI by using .Net Core CLI as a [global tool](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli/install-global-tool.md). However, it can also be download from the [Octopus downloads page](https://octopus.com/downloads), or using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/OctopusTools)

Learn more about using [octo](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli/index.md).
