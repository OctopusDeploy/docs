When you self-host the Octopus Deploy server, you need to manually upgrade the server to take advantage of features in new releases of Octopus Deploy. If you are an [Octopus Cloud][/docs/octopus-concepts/octopus-cloud.md] customer, we manage the Octopus server for you, ensuring you have early access to all the latest features.

If you are upgrading a version of Octopus Deploy prior to version 3, we have supported upgrade paths that will help you upgrade to a modern version of Octopus Deploy: [Upgrading older versions of Octopus](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/index.md).
