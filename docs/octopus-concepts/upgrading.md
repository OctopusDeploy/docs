When you self-host the Octopus Server, you need to manually upgrade the server to take advantage of features in new releases of Octopus Deploy. 

If you are upgrading a version of Octopus Deploy prior to version 3, we have supported upgrade paths that will help you upgrade to a modern version of Octopus Deploy: [Upgrading older versions of Octopus](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/index.md).
