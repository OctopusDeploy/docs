Octopus Deploy is built **API-first**. This means that everything Octopus Deploy can do, can been done by the API.

[Octo.exe](/docs/octopus-concepts/octo.exe.md) is the command-line tool that interacts with the REST API and can be used to manage your Octopus server, infrastructure, and deployments.

Octopus includes a [Migration API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/migration-api/index.md) that provides the ability to back-up and restore parts of an Octopus Deploy instance remotely.
