description: The step involved in building a Forms based Authentication Provider.

All Forms based providers share the Username/Password/Remember Me UI shipping with the Octopus Deploy UI.  To participate as a Forms based authentication provider you must:

- Host an API endpoint that:
    * expects a Http POST of a LoginCommand object.
    * returns a JSON representation of an IUser and a cookie, as returned by a call to IAuthCookieCreator.CreateAuthCookie.
- Implement the IAuthenticationProvider interface and have:
    * GetAuthenticationProviderElement return an element with:
        * a Name.
        * FormsLoginEnabled = true.
        * Links containing path to the API from above.
    * GetAuthenticationUrls return the same API url (which is used to whitelisting APIs when in MaintenanceMode etc).
- Implement whatever configuration storage you require.

The Octopus Deploy [UsernamePasswordAuthenticaionProvider](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/UsernamePasswordAuthenticationProvider) on GitHub provides a good reference point.
