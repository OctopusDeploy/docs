This guide is for customers managing their self-hosted installation of Octopus. If you are using Octopus Cloud we take care of everything for you, and you will have early access to all the latest features.

We highly recommend using releases with long-term support (LTS) for your self-hosted installation of Octopus. We ship a new release with LTS every 3 months, where each release comes with 6 months of support. Learn about our [long-term support program](long-term-support.md).

Everything you need can be [downloaded from our web site](https://octopus.com/downloads).
