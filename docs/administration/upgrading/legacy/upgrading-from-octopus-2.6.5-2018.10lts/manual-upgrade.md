You can upgrade between **Octopus 2.6** and **Octopus 3.x** by downloading the latest [MSI's for both Octopus and Tentacle](https://octopus.com/download), and installing them manually. If you're working with a large number of Tentacles, see the section on [upgrading larger installations](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/upgrading-from-octopus-2.6.5-2018.10lts/index.md).

## Summary {#Manualupgrade-Summary}

1. Backup your **Octopus 2.6** database and master key.
2. Install **Octopus 3.x** on your Octopus Server.
3. Migrate your data from **Octopus 2.6** to **Octopus 3.x**.
4. Install **Tentacle 3.x** on your deployment targets.
 1. For **Octopus 3.0.1**: Reinstall the Tentacle Service.
5. Verify the connectivity between the **Octopus 3.x** Server and the 3.x Tentacles.
6. **[Optional]** Clean up your Octopus Home folder, follow the instructions on this [page](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/server-configuration-and-file-storage\index.md#ServerconfigurationandFilestorage-CleanUp).

## Step by Step {#Manualupgrade-Stepbystep}

To perform an in-place upgrade, follow these steps:

:::problem
There is a current issue where it is not importing your license key. Please back this up first from {{Configuration,License}}.
:::

### 1. Back up Your Octopus 2.6 Database and Master Key {#Manualupgrade-1.BackupyourOctopus2.6databaseandmasterkey}

See the [Backup and restore](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/upgrading-from-octopus-2.6.5-2018.10lts/backup-2.6.md)[ page for instructions on backing up your database.](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/upgrading-from-octopus-2.6.5-2018.10lts/backup-2.6.md)

### 2. Install Octopus 3.x On Your Octopus Server {#Manualupgrade-2.InstallOctopus3.xonyourOctopusServer}

:::success
**Upgrade to the latest version**
When upgrading to **Octopus 3.x** please use the latest version available. We have been constantly improving the **Octopus 2.6** to **Octopus 3.x** data migration process whilst adding new features and fixing bugs.
:::

See the [Installing Octopus 3.x](/docs/installation/index.md) page for instructions on installing a new **Octopus 3.x** instance.

After installing the MSI, you will be presented with an upgrade page.

![](/docs/images/3048132/3278008.png "width=500")

Click "Get started..." and set up your database connection. You may need to grant permission to the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account at this stage.

![](/docs/images/3048132/3278007.png "width=500")

Click Next, and then Install to install the **Octopus 3.x** server over the **Octopus 2.6** instance.

### 3. Restore the Octopus 2.6 Database Using the Migration Tool {#Manualupgrade-3.RestoretheOctopus2.6databaseusingthemigrationtool}

After upgrading, the Octopus Manager will prompt to import your **Octopus 2.6** database. Click the "Import data..." button and follow the prompts to import your **Octopus 2.6** data.

![](/docs/images/3048132/3278005.png "width=500")

See the [Migrating data from Octopus 2.6 to 3.x](/docs/administration/upgrading/legacy/upgrading-from-octopus-2.6.5-2018.10lts/migrating-data-from-octopus-2.6.5-2018.10lts.md) page for more detailed instructions on importing your **Octopus 2.6** database backup into **Octopus 3.x**.

:::hint
**Migration taking a long time?**
By default we migrate everything from your backup including historical data. You can use the `maxage=` argument when executing the migrator to limit the number of days to keep. For example: `maxage=90` will keep 90 days of historical data ignoring anything older.

To see the command syntax click the **Show script** link in the wizard
:::

:::hint
**Using the built-in Octopus NuGet repository?**
If you use the built-in [Octopus NuGet repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md) you will need to move the files from your **Octopus 2.6** server to your **Octopus 3.x** server. They are not part of the backup.
In a standard **Octopus 2.6** install the files can be found under `C:\Octopus\OctopusServer\Repository\Packages`
You will need to transfer them to the new server to `C:\Octopus\Packages` Once the files have been copied, you will need to restart the Octopus Server service to re-index the files - The index runs in the background, so if you have a lot of packages it could take a while (5-20 mins) to show in the UI or be usable for deployments.
:::

### 4. Install the Tentacle 3.x MSI {#Manualupgrade-4.InstalltheTentacle3.xMSI}

At this point, the machines should appear in your Environments page inside **Octopus 3.x**, but a health check will fail - the communication protocol **Octopus 3.x** uses isn't compatible with **Tentacle 2.6**.

On each machine that ran **Tentacle 2.6**, connect to the machine, and install the **Tentacle 3.x** MSI.

#### 4.a For Octopus 3.0.1: Reinstall the Tentacle Service {#Manualupgrade-4.aForOctopus3.0.1:ReinstalltheTentacleService}

We discovered an issue with the Tentacle Installer for **Octopus 3.0.1** where the Tentacle windows service would still be pointing to the 2.x binaries from a previous 2.x automatic Tentacle upgrade. This has been fixed and is scheduled for **Octopus 3.0.2**.

Click the Reinstall button to ensure the Tentacle windows service is pointing to the correct version of Tentacle.exe.

![](/docs/images/3048134/3278285.png "width=500")

:::hint
**Modified the Tentacle windows service?**
Reinstall will uninstall and reinstall the Tentacle windows service. If you're running Tentacle under a non-default set of credentials or you have configured non-default recovery options you will need to reinstate that configuration after the Reinstall is complete.
:::

### 5. Verify Connectivity Between the 3.x Server and 3.x Tentacles {#Manualupgrade-5.Verifyconnectivitybetweenthe3.xserverand3.xTentacles}

Log in to your new **Octopus 3.x** server and run health checks on all of your environments. If the upgrade completed successfully, they should succeed.

![](/docs/images/3048132/3278009.png "width=500")

If one or more health checks do not succeed after a few attempts, see the Troubleshooting section to identify possible issues.
