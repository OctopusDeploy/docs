:::problem
You can not migrate from Deployment Manager directly to version 3.x of Octopus Deploy. Instead you'll need to migrate to Octopus Deploy 2.6, then upgrade to Octopus Deploy 3:

- Follow the instructions on the [Migrating from Redgate Deployment Manager to Octopus Deploy](http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD2/Migrating+from+Redgate+Deployment+Manager+to+Octopus+Deploy) page to move to Octopus Deploy
- Follow the instructions on the [Migrating data from Octopus 2.6 to 3.x](/docs/home/administration/upgrading/upgrading-from-octopus-2.6/migrating-data-from-octopus-2.6-to-3.x.md) page to upgrade to the latest version of Octopus Deploy
