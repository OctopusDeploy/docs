:::hint
Octopus ID authentication is available only in **Octopus Cloud**
:::

Octopus ID authentication allows you to log in to your Octopus Cloud instance using the same account that you use to sign in at octopus.com.

Support for Octopus ID will be progressively rolled out to Octopus Cloud. Configuration for this feature is handled by the Octopus Cloud infrastructure so no user configuration is required.

For more information about using your Octopus Cloud instance, see our [Octopus Cloud](../../octopus-cloud/index.md) documentation.
