:::hint
Octopus ID authentication is available only in **Octopus Cloud**
:::

Octopus ID authentication allows you to log in to your Octopus Cloud instance using the same account that you use to sign in at octopus.com.

Support for Octopus ID will be progressively rolled out to Octopus Cloud, and configuration is handled by the hosted Octopus infrastructure so no user configuration is required.
