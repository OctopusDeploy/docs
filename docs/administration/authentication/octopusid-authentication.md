:::hint
Octopus ID authentication is available only in **Octopus Cloud**
:::

Octopus ID authentication allows you to log in to your Octopus Cloud instance using the same account that you use to sign in at octopus.com.

Support for Octopus ID authentication will be progressively rolled out to Octopus Cloud instances, and configured automatically.

For more information about using your Octopus Cloud instance, see our [Octopus Cloud](../../octopus-cloud/index.md) documentation.
