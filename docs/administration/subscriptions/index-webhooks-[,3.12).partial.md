## Webhook Notifications {#Subscriptions-WebhookNotifications}

Webhook notifications allow you to receive a JSON payload, posted to a specified URL when events have occurred. Webhook notifications will be sent **per event** (unlike email notifications that send a digest of events) and will include a payload with the following structure:

```powershell
{
  "Timestamp": "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
  "EventType": "SubscriptionPayload",
  "Payload": {
    "ServerUri": "http://my-octopus.com",
    "ServerAuditUri": "http://my-octopus.com",
    "BatchProcessingDate": "0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
    "Subscription": {},
    "Event": {}
  }
}
```

The `Payload` includes:

| Property                     | Hint | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| ServerUri                    | \* |  The Octopus server that generated this webhook |
| ServerAuditUri               | \* | The URL to the Octopus server's audit screen where this event may be found in more detail |
| Subscription                 | | The subscription object that triggered this webhook (including all filtering criteria so you can see exactly why you are receiving this webhook) |
| Event                        | | The event object that this webhook is responding to |
| BatchProcessingDate          | | The processing date for the current batch. For 'Single' payload types, the events will be sent in batches. The batch date is included here for your reference |

\* This property will be null unless the publicly-accessible URL has been set for your Octopus instance (see the {{Configuration,Nodes,Configuration Settings}} menu).

:::hint
**Consuming events**
While we make every effort to ensure events are only ever sent *once* to a given email or webhook subscription, we can offer no guarantees and advise that you design your comsuming API with this in mind.
