Subscriptions are available in Octopus Deploy 3.5 and later
:::

Subscriptions allow you to subscribe to events that are happening within Octopus, so you can be notified when events have occurred and react accordingly. Both **email** and **webhook** notifications are currently supported.

Subscriptions can be accessed from the `Configuration` menu.

**Running on an Octopus version below 3.12?**
For earlier versions of Octopus, Subscriptions can be accessed from the `Configuration` > `Audit` > `Subscriptions` menu. See the version-selector of the documentation to jump to your specific Octopus version.
