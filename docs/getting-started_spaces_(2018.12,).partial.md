## Spaces

If you're a large organization with lots of teams working in Octopus, from **2019.1** you can use the [Spaces](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md) feature to provide each of your teams with a space for the projects, environments, and infrastructure they work with, while keeping other team's assets separate in their own spaces.
