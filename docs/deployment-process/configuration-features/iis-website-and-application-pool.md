The IIS Web Site and Application Pool feature is one of the [configuration features](/docs/deployment-process/configuration-features/index.md) you can enable as you define the [steps](/docs/deployment-process/steps/index.md) in your [deployment process](/docs/deployment-process/index.md).

The **IIS Web Site and Application Pool** feature is available on **deploy a package** steps, however, there is also a **Deploy to IIS** step which offers the same features and is designed specifically for IIS deployments. See [IIS Websites and Applications](/docs/deployment-examples/iis-website-and-application-pools.md) for more details.
