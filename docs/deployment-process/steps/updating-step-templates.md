Step Templates are effectively copied to projects using them. That means if you update a step template, you'll need to update the step in the project using it for your changes to have an effect.

If your project is using an out-of-date step template, you will see a warning when editing that step in the deployment process of your project. You can click the `Update` button to start using the latest version.
