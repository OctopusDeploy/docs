In the variable-editor, selecting *Certificate* as the [variable](/docs/deployment-process/variables/index.md) type allows you to create a variable with a certificate managed by Octopus as the value.

Certificate variables can be [scoped](/docs/deployment-process/variables/index.md#scoping-variables), similar to regular text variables.

## Expanded Properties

At deploy-time, Certificate variables are expanded. For example, a variable _MyCertificate_ becomes:

| Variable                        | Description                                            | Example value |

| MyCertificate.Certificate       | The base64 encoded DER ASN.1 certificate.              |
| MyCertificate.PrivateKey        | The base64 encoded DER ASN.1 private key. This will be stored and transmitted as a [sensitive variable](/docs/deployment-process/variables/sensitive-variables.md).                |
| MyCertificate.CertificatePem    | The PEM representation of the certificate (i.e. the PublicKey with header\footer).  |
| MyCertificate.PrivateKeyPem     | The PEM representation of the private key (i.e. the PrivateKey with header\footer).  |

For example, to access the certificate thumbprint in a PowerShell script:

```powershell
Write-Host $OctopusParameters["MyCertificate.Thumbprint"]
```
