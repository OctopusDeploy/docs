| **`Octopus.Web.ServerUri`** <br/>The default URL at which the server portal can be accessed, as configured in the Configuration/Nodes settings. **Introduced in Octopus 2019.4.0.** | *[https://my-octopus](https://my-octopus)* |

## Tracking Deployment Status {#Systemvariables-DeploymentStatusTrackingdeploymentstatus}

During deployment, Octopus provides variables describing the status of each step.

Where `S` is the step name, Octopus will set:

```powershell
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Code
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Error
Octopus.Step[S].Status.ErrorDetail
```

Status codes include `Pending`, `Skipped`, `Abandoned`, `canceled`, `Running`, `Succeeded` and `Failed`.

For an action `A:`

```powershell
Octopus.Action[A].IsSkipped
```

For the deployment as a whole:

```powershell
Octopus.Deployment.Error
Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail
```

:::hint
**Error detail returned**
Octopus.Deployment.Error and Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail will only display the exit code and Octopus stack trace for the error. As we cannot parse the deployment log, we can only extract the exit/error codes. It cannot show detailed information on what caused the error. For full information on what happened when the deployment fails, you will need to reference the logs.
