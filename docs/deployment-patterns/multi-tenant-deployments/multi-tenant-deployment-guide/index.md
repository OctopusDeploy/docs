This guide will introduce you to multi-tenant deployments in Octopus, starting with simple scenarios, then incorporating more complex capabilities over time.

:::hint
Multi-tenant deployments are an advanced pattern, and this guide assumes you are already familiar with Octopus concepts like [projects](/docs/projects/index.md), [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md), [lifecycles](/docs/deployment-process/lifecycles/index.md), [variables](/docs/projects/variables/index.md) and [deploying applications](/docs/deployment-examples/index.md).

## Sample tenants

If you'd like to play with a fully-fledge sample, we've built a tool that will will build up an entire multi-tenant scenario in your Octopus Server using the API with as many projects and tenants you would like.
