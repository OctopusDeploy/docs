The simplest way to create a NuGet package is to create it manually, using the NuGet Package Explorer. This isn't how we recommend creating your packages most of the time (read more about [OctoPack](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack.md)), but it's a good way to get started, or when deploying one-off utilities.

:::hint
NuGet Package Explorer is an open source desktop application that makes it easy to view and create NuGet packages. You can download it from [the official NuGet Package Explorer website](http://npe.codeplex.com/).
