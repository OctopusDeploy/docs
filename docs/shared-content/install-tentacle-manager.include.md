Before you can configure your Windows servers as Tentacles, you need to install Tentacle Manager on the machines that you plan to use as Tentacles.

Tentacle Manager is the Windows application that configures your Tentacle. Once installed, you can access it from your start menu/start screen. Tentacle Manager can configure Tentacles to use a [proxy](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/proxy-support.md), delete the Tentacle, and show diagnostic information about the Tentacle.

1. Start the Tentacle installer, accept the license agreement, and follow the onscreen prompts.
2. When the Octopus Deploy Tentacle Setup Wizard has completed, click **Finish** to exit the wizard.
3. When the Tentacle Manager launches, click **GET STARTED**.
