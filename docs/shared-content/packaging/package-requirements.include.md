Before you can deploy a package you need to:

1. Give your package a [package ID](#package-id).
1. Choose and apply a [versioning scheme](#version-numbers).
1. Create the package in a [supported format](#supported-formats).
1. Host the package in a [package repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md).

For instance, `hello-world.1.0.0.zip`.
