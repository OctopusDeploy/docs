A release is a snapshot of the deployment process and the associated assets that existed when the release was created. These assets include scripts, any references to package versions, and variables (excluding [tenant variables](/docs/tenants/tenant-variables.md)). A version number is assigned to a release. Releases can be deployed as often as necessary, even if the deployment process has since been changed for newer releases.

When you deploy a release, you are executing the deployment process with all the associated details as they existed when the release was created.
