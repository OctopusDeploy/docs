Operations Runbooks automate routine maintenance and emergency operations tasks, such as infrastructure provisioning, database management, and website failover and restoration. Operations Runbooks include all the necessary permissions for the infrastructure they run on, so anybody on the team can execute the runbook, and because they're managed in Octopus there's a complete audit trail. Runbooks can be parameterized with prompted variables so that human interaction is required. 

Runbooks belong to projects. To create or manage your Operations Runbooks, navigate to Project ➜ Operations ➜ Runbooks.
