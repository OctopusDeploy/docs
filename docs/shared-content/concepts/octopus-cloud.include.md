Octopus Cloud is the hosted version of Octopus Deploy. It has been publicly available since February 2018.

We designed Octopus Cloud and self-hosted Octopus to provide the same functionality; however, there are some minor differences, for instance, with Octopus Cloud, we're [responsible](/docs/administration/security/index.md#responsibility) for taking backups, automatically upgrading the service, and maintaining and monitoring the underlying systems. For security reasons some of the configuration and diagnostic functionality has been limited in Octopus Cloud.

You can sign up for Octopus Cloud at [octopus.com/register](https://octopus.com/register), check out the [Octopus Cloud FAQ](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-cloud-faq) blog post, visit the [pricing page](https://octopus.com/pricing/cloud), or read on if you're just getting started with Octopus Cloud.
