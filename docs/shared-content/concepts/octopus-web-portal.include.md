Whether you're self-hosting the Octopus Server or using Octopus Cloud, the Octopus Web Portal is where you manage your infrastructure, deployments, releases, operations processes, access the built-in repository, grant your team access to projects, and create your automated deployment processes.

The dashboard in the Octopus Web Portal shows the status of your deployments across your environments.
