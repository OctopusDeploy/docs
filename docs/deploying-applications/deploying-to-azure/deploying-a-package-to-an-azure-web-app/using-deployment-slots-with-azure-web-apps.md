[Deployment Slots](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-staged-publishing/) provide a nice way to implement [Blue-Green deployments](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html) for Azure Web Apps.

This provides many benefits, including:

- Reduced down-time when deploying.
- When deploying packages with a large number of files, deployment times can be significantly reduced due to not having to compare with existing files (this assumes you are deploying to a clean slot).
- Roll-back can be achieved by simply swapping the slots back.

:::warning
Deployment Slots are only available to Azure Web Apps running in Standard or Premium [App Service plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/plans/)
:::

See the [Azure Web Blue-Green Sample project](https://demo.octopusdeploy.com/app#/projects/azure-web-blue-green-sample/process) on our demo server, for a complete example.

## Walk-Through {#UsingDeploymentSlotswithAzureWebApps-Walk-Through}

Here we will give an example of how to setup a Blue-Green deployment for an Azure Web App using Deployment Slots.

### Step 1: Create Staging Slot {#UsingDeploymentSlotswithAzureWebApps-Step1:CreateStagingSlot}

Create a [Run an Azure PowerShell Script](/docs/guides/azure-deployments/running-azure-powershell/index.md) step.

![](/docs/images/3049371/3278543.png "width=500")

Assuming you have a variable named 'WebSite' that contains the name of your Azure Web Site, your script should be:

**Azure Service Management**

```powershell
#Remove the staging slot if it exists
Remove-AzureWebsite -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging -Force

#Create the staging slot
New-AzureWebsite -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging
```

**Azure Resource Manager**

```powershell
#Remove the staging slot if it exists
Remove-AzureRMWebAppSlot -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -Force -ErrorAction Continue

#Create the staging slot
New-AzureRMWebAppSlot -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup
```

:::hint
The reason for the first line, which removes the Staging Slot, is to ensure we are deploying to a clean slot.  This can significantly reduce the time taken for deployments with a large number of files.
:::

So your step should look like:

### Step 2: Deploy your Package {#UsingDeploymentSlotswithAzureWebApps-Step2:DeployyourPackage}

The next step is to deploy your package to the Staging slot.  We do this by creating a [Deploy an Azure Web App](/docs/deploying-applications/deploying-to-azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-web-app/index.md) step.

![](/docs/images/3049371/3278554.png "width=500")

:::hint
Slots in Azure are themselves real Web Apps with their own hostnames.  They are named with the format:

```
WebsiteName(SlotName) 
```
:::

If your Staging Slot already exists, you can see it in the select-list of available sites for your account.

![](/docs/images/3049371/3278555.png "width=500")

To use a variable for the WebSite name, check the "Use a Custom Expression" box, and enter

```
#{WebsiteName}(Staging)
```

As shown below:

![](/docs/images/3049371/3278556.png "width=500")

### Step 3: Swap the Staging and Production Slots {#UsingDeploymentSlotswithAzureWebApps-Step3:SwaptheStagingandProductionSlots}

The final step is to create another Azure PowerShell step to swap the Staging and Production slots.

Use the PowerShell:

**Azure Service Management**

```powershell
#Swap the staging slot into production
Switch-AzureWebsiteSlot -Name #{WebSite} -Slot1 Staging -Slot2 Production -Force
```

**Azure Resource Management**

```powershell
#Swap the staging slot into production
Switch-AzureRmWebAppSlot -ResourceGroupName #{ResourceGroup} -Name #{Website} -SourceSlotName Staging -DestinationSlotName Production
```

So your step will appear as:

![](/docs/images/3049371/3278558.png "width=500")

At this point you should have a working Blue-Green deployment process for your Azure Web App.
