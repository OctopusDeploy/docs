Dynamic Worker Pools are a special type of [worker pool](/docs/infrastructure/workers/worker-pools.md) used by our cloud product to intialize a group of [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md), when a task is assigned to a worker, the task will be executed by one of the workers in the pool.

The Default Worker Pool in our latest cloud instances are configured to use a Dynamic Worker Pool, which means it displays some different characteristics to older cloud instances and our self-hosted product.

### On Demand

Workers are created on demand and are assigned to a customer when required. Once you've finished using a worker, the worker is destroyed and not reused.

### Isolated

To ensure your tasks are isolated from other customers workers. This isolation is provided at the network layer (each worker is placed in its own dedeicated subnet).
 
::: info
Customers cannot make changes to the default worker pool, or the configuration of the workers themeselves. The workers themselves are provisioned using our own service, meaning you don't need to configure anything for them to work in your environment.
