ECS Cluster targets are used by the [ECS steps](/docs/deployments/aws/index.md) to define the context in which deployments and scripts are run.

:::hint
Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create_cluster.html) for detailed instructions on how to provision a new ECS cluster.

## Creating an ECS cluster target

1. Navigate to **{{Infrastructure,Deployment Targets}}**, and click **ADD DEPLOYMENT TARGET**.
2. Select **AWS** and click **ADD** on the Amazon ECS Cluster target type.
3. Enter a display name for the Amazon ECS Cluster.
4. Select at least one [environment](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md) for the target.
5. Select at least one [target role](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/index.md#target-roles) for the target.
6. In the **ECS Cluster** section:

    - Select an AWS account. If you don't have an `AWS Account` defined yet, check our [documentation on how to set one up](/docs/infrastructure/accounts/aws/index.md).
    - Enter the AWS region where the ECS cluster is running in AWS. 
    - Enter a cluster name that matches the cluster name running in your AWS region.
