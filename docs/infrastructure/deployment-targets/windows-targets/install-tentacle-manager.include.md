To install Tentacles, you must first install Tentacle Manager on the machines where you will install the Tentacles.

Tentacle Manager is the Windows application that configures your Tentacle. Once installed, you can access it from your start menu/start screen. Tentacle Manager can configure Tentacles to use a [proxy](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/proxy-support.md), delete the Tentacle, and show diagnostic information about the Tentacle.

2. When the Octopus Deploy Tentacle Setup Wizard has completed, click **Finish** to exit the wizard.
3. When the Tentacle Manager launches, click **Get Started...** and **Next**.
4. Accept the default *configuration and log* directory and *application* directory or choose different locations and click **Next**.
