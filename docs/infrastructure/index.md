With Octopus Deploy you can deploy software to Windows servers, Linux servers, Microsoft Azure, AWS, an offline package drop, cloud regions, or Kubernetes.

## Deployment Targets

The machines and services that you deploy to are your *deployment targets*. Learn about adding and configuring the different types of [deployment targets](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/index.md), the [target roles](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/target-roles/index.md) that are assigned to the deployment targets, and [dynamic infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/dynamic-infrastructure/index.md).

## Environments

Octopus organizes your deployment targets into groups called [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md) so you can promote your software through different stages of its lifecycle, for instance, from **Development** to **Test** to **Production**.

Learn about [Environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md).

## Workers

You can use [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) to perform tasks that don't need to be performed on a deployment target or on the Octopus Server.

Learn about [Workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) and [Worker Pools](/docs/infrastructure/workers/worker-pools.md).
