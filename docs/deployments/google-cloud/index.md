Currently, Octopus Deploy provides support for Google cloud deployments with the **Run gcloud in a Script** step.

The **Run gcloud in a Script** step can be used to execute scripts on targets within Google cloud platforms.

:::hint
**Where do Google Cloud Steps execute?**
All Google cloud steps execute on a worker. By default, that will be the built-in worker in the Octopus Server. Learn about [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) and the different configuration options.
