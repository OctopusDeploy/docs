When you contact Octopus Deploy support with a deployment-related issue, we'll sometimes ask you to send the full task log, so that we can understand what went wrong. This page explains how to capture the full task log.

## Step-by-step Guide {#Gettherawoutputfromatask-Step-by-stepguide}

The steps to send a full task log are:

1. Open the deployment/task details, and go to the **Task log** tab. Click on the **Raw** link.

2. At the top of the raw log page there is a **Download** button. Click the button to download a text file containing the entire deployment log:

Send this file to us, or attach it to your support request.

You might want to open the file in a text editor, and redact any sensitive information like hostnames or company information, before sending the log to us.
