This section describes the multi-tenancy feature of Octopus Deploy.

## Multi-tenancy in Octopus {#tenants-multi-tenancyinoctopus}

Tenants in Octopus Deploy allow you to easily manage separate instances of your application in an environment. Without tenants, you can only deploy a single instance of your application to an environment.

Tenants enable:

1. Deploying multiple instances of your project to the sameÂ [Environment](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md).
2. Managing configuration settings unique to each tenant.
3. Promoting releases using safe tenant-aware lifecycles.
4. Tailoring the deployment process using tenant tags.
5. Deploying to shared or dedicated infrastructure per tenant.
6. Limiting access to tenants by scoping team roles to tenants.
7. Creating release rings so that you can easily deploy to alpha and beta tenants.
8. Managing large groups tenants using tenant tags.
9. Building simple multi-tenant deployment processes that can scale as you add more tenants.

### Types of tenants {#tenants-typesoftenants}

We designed tenants to be generic so that they can satisfy multiple use cases.

Tenants usually represent the customers of your application, especially when it comes to SaaS products.

Tenants can also represent:

- Developers, testers, or other team members
- Feature branches
- Geographical regions or datacenters

### When to use tenants {#tenants-whentousetenants}

:::success
You don't need tenants to implement a multi-tenant SaaS application. You can architect your application so that one instance can serve multiple customers. We built multi-tenancy for situations where you want to deploy your application more than once in an environment.
:::

Here are some signs that you should consider using tenants:

- You need to deploy different versions of your application to the same environment.
- You are creating multiple environments of the same type. This could be multiple Test environments for different testers or multiple Production environments for different customers.
