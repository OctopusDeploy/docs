Octopus currently supports blocking deployments for a project and environment based on the 
approval status of a Change Request in a supported ITSM system. Currently, both ServiceNow and 
Jira Service Desk are supported.

For more information, read our documentation on [Service Now Integration](service-now/index.md) 
and [Jira Service Management Integration](jira-service-management/index.md).
