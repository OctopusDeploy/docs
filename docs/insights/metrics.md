The metrics are calculated in real time based on deployment completions.

## Deployment frequency

The deployment frequency is the total number of successful deployments for a given time period.

## Deployment lead time

The lead time for a given deployment is the time from the deployment's completion date, back to the creation date of the earliest release whose changes have not been deployed to the given environment.

## Deployment failure rate

Failure rate is calculated by taking the total number of deployments, and dividing them by the number of failures as a percentage.

## Mean time to recovery

For a given failed deployment, its time to recovery is the time period from its completion time, to the completion time of the next successful deployment within the same scope.
