A CSV of the deployments and associated Insights data can be downloaded via the `DOWNLOAD CSV` link underneath the chart
on each of the single metric pages. 

On the project pages, the last 12 months of data that matches the channel, environment and tenant filter is returned.

On the Insights report pages, the last 12 months of data that matches the selection in the report settings is returned. Note that
any deployments that you do not have permission to view are omitted.

The same data is available in JSON format via an API call.
