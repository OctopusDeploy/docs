[Octo.exe](/docs/api-and-integration/octo.exe-command-line/index.md)Â can be used to delete/remove machines with a particular status from environments on your Octopus instance.

:::hint
This command was added in Octo.exe 3.3.4.
:::

:::success
This is most useful when your environments can have temporary/ephemeral machines. The best example of this is in virtualized or cloud environments where new machines are created and destroyed frequently.
:::

:::success
**Using Octopus 3.4 or newer?**
We added first-class support for automatically [cleaning up environments](/docs/deployment-patterns/elastic-and-transient-environments/cleaning-up-environments.md).
