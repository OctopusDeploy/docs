[Octo.exe](/docs/api-and-integration/octo.exe-command-line/index.md) can be used to delete releases from your Octopus instance. Releases deleted this way **cannot be recovered**.

:::success
**Using Channels?**
If you are using [channels](/docs/deployment-process/channels/index.md) (introduced in **Octopus 3.2**) you can filter this command so it only deletes releases for a particular channel.
:::

```bash
octo delete-releases [<options>]
```

Where `[<options>]` is any of:

**delete-releases options**

## Basic Example {#Deletingreleases-Basicexample}

The following command will delete all the releases from the project **Web** between versions **0.0.8** to **0.0.12**.

```bash
octo delete-releases --project Web --minversion="0.0.8" --maxversion="0.0.12" --server http://MyOctopusServerURL.com --apikey MyAPIKey
```

:::warning
On the example above, both **minversion** and **maxversion** will be delete as well. The complete list of releases deleted by that command will be:

0.0.8, 0.0.9, 0.0.10, 0.0.11, 0.0.12.
