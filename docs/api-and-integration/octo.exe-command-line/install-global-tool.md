Microsoft introduced the ability to install tools using the .NET Core CLI called [Global Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools). This enables octo to be conveniently installed onto machine or build agent as long as you have the .NET Core `2.1.300` SDK available.

## Specific Location
A local installation can be done into a specified location using the `--tool-path` parameter.

```bash
dotnet tool install Octopus.DotNet.Cli --tool-path /path/for/tool --version <version>
```
This will install Octo into the specified location and generate a platform specific executable
called `dotnet-octo` into the specified location. In order to enable `dotnet` to be able to find
your custom tool location, you will need to add the tool location to the current environment path.

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$env:PATH = "your\tool\folder;" + $env:PATH
```

**Bash**
```
export PATH="$PATH:/your/tool/folder"
```

Once the tool folder is in the path you can run octo commands using dotnet such as `dotnet octo pack`

## User Installation
In order to install Octo for the current user you can do so by installing the tool globally using
`--global` flag.

```bash
dotnet tool install Octopus.DotNet.Cli --global --version 4.39.1
```
You may also omit the `--version` parameter to install the latest version of the tools.

### Updating
In order to update to the latest version of the tool you can use the `dotnet update` command

```bash
dotnet tool update Octopus.DotNet.Cli --global
```

If you would like to update to a specific version or downgrade to an older version you can do
so by first uninstalling the tool and installing it again.

```bash
dotnet tool uninstall Octopus.DotNet.Cli --global
dotnet tool install Octopus.DotNet.Cli --global --version <version>
```
