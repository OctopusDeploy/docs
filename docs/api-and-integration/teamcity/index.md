## Using Octopus as a Package Repository {#TeamCity-PushpackagestoOctopusUsingOctopusasaPackageRepository}

Octopus can be used as a [NuGet package repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/built-in-repository/index.md), or it can be configured to use an external feed (such as retrieving them from TeamCity).

To push packages to Octopus during the OctoPack phase, enter the NuGet endpoint URL into the **Publish packages to http** field, and [an API key](/docs/api-and-integration/api/how-to-create-an-api-key.md) in the **Publish API Key** field.  OctoPack will then push the packages when the solution is built.  You'll find the URL to your repository on the **{{Library,Packages}}** tab in Octopus.  Simply click the `Show examples` link to see options to upload packages including the repository URL.

## Using the Plugin With Linux Build Agents {#TeamCity-LinuxAgentsUsingthepluginwithLinuxbuildagents}

Traditionally the Octopus TeamCity plugin required a Windows build agent to work. As of version 4.2.1 will run on Linux build agents if they meet either **one** of the following requirements:

1. Have [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) installed on the build agent and in the PATH such that the `dotnet` command runs successfully. To install, follow the linked guide to install the .NET Core SDK for your distribution. Ensure that the `dotnet` command runs successfully. From version 4.15.10 of the plugin .NET Core v2 is required.
2. Have the Octo command line tool installed and in the PATH such that the `Octo` command runs successfully. To install, download the .tar.gz for you system from the [Octopus download page](https://octopus.com/downloads), extract somewhere appropriate and symlink `Octo` into your PATH. Again, ensure that `Octo` runs successfully. On Ubuntu you may need to install `libunwind8` using your package manager.
