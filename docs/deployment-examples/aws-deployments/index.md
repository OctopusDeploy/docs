Octopus Deploy provides first-class support for deploying AWS CloudFormation templates and uploading files to s3 buckets.

The **Deploy an AWS CloudFormation Template** step can be used to create or update a CloudFormation stack, while the **Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack** step can be used to delete an existing CloudFormation stack.

:::hint
**Where do AWS Steps execute?**
All AWS steps execute on a worker.  By default, that will be the built-in worker in the Octopus Server. Learn about [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) and the different configuration options.
