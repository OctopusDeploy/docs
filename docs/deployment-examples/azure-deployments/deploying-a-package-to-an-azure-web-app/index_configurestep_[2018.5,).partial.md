## Step 2: Create an Azure Account {#DeployingapackagetoanAzureWebApp-Step2:CreateanAzureAccount}

If you haven't already, create an [Azure Account](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/azure/index.md) to grant Octopus Deploy access to your Azure Subscription.

If instead you want to **dynamically** create you account during your deployment, check our [documentation on how to do so](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/dynamic-infrastructure/index.md)

## Step 3: Configure your Azure Web App Step. {#DeployingapackagetoanAzureWebApp-Step4:ConfigureyourAzureWebAppstep}

- Dynamically during the deployment using scripts. [See documentation](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/dynamic-infrastructure/index.md)
