Octopus provides integrated support for deploying Kubernetes resources such as [deployments](/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes-deployments/deploy-container/index.md), [services](/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes-deployments/deploy-service/index.md), and [ingress](/docs/deployment-examples/kubernetes-deployments/deploy-ingress/index.md), as well as running scripts against a Kubernetes cluster.

## Kubernetes targets

Kubernetes targets are used by the Kubernetes steps to define the context in which deployments and scripts are run. Learn how to configure [Kubernetes deployment targets](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/kubernetes-target/index.md).
