Along with teh ability to automate the creation of AWS resources, CloudFormation provides a simple method for destroying the resources it created as part of a stack.  Using a runbook, you can automate tearing down environments when they're no longer needed.

## Create the runbook

1. To create a runbook, navigate to **{{Project, Operations, Runbooks, Add Runbook}}**.
1. Give the runbook a name and click **SAVE**.
1. Click **DEFINE YOUR RUNBOOK PROCESS**, then click **ADD STEP**.
1. Add a **Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack** step
1. Fill in the parameters for the template
| Parameter  | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Region | The region your resources are located | us-west-1 |
| CloudFormation stack name | Name of existing stack | MySuperStack |

In a single step, you can destroy all the resources created within a CloudFormation stack.
