Runbooks are a powerful tool that can be used to ensure that infrastructure is created in a repeatable and consistent fashion.  Octopus comes with a number of built-in step templates to help interface with the AWS cloud platform

- Run an AWS CLI Script
- Deploy an AWS CloudFormation template
- Apply an AWS CloudFormation Change Set
- Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack
- Upload a package to an AWS S3 bucket

Combining the power of runbooks and AWS, you can easily automate common tasks such as:

- Creating resource stacks with CloudFormation
- Managing firewall rules
- Destroying resources
