:::warning
Azure Web App deployment targets have been deprecated in Octopus 3.1, and have been replaced by the 'Deploy an Azure Web App Step'.
Don't worry - you can migrate your Azure Targets to use the equivalent Azure Steps by following [this guide](/docs/how-to/migrate-azure-targets-into-azure-steps.md).
:::

Octopus Deploy supports automated deployment of [Azure Web Apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/) (formerly known as Azure Web Sites).

## Azure Web App Deployment Target {#AzureWebApps-AzureWebAppDeploymentTarget}

In Environments you can create Azure Web App Deployment Targets.

:::hint
For more information on deploying Azure Web Apps with Octopus using this deployment target please refer to [deploying a package to an Azure Web App](/docs/deploying-applications/deploying-to-azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-web-app/index.md). The same options and process is used by the deployment target and the deployment step.
