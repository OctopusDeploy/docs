The Azure VM Extension cannot be installed via the Classic Azure Portal, as it lacks support for adding extensions. We recommend either using the new Azure Portal, or using the [CLI](via-the-azure-cli.md) or [PowerShell](via-powershell.md) methods.

For further information, please see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/classic/manage-extensions?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2fclassic%2ftoc.json).
