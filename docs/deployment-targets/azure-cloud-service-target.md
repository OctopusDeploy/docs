:::warning
Azure Cloud Service deployment targets have been deprecated in Octopus 3.1, and have been replaced by the 'Deploy an Azure Cloud Service' step.
Don't worry - you can migrate your Azure Targets to use the equivalent Azure Steps by following [this guide](/docs/how-to/migrate-azure-targets-into-azure-steps.md).
:::

Azure Cloud Service is available as a deployment target.

:::hint
For more information on deploying Azure Cloud Services with Octopus using this deployment target please refer to [deploying a package to an Azure Cloud Service](/docs/deploying-applications/deploying-to-azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-cloud-service/index.md). The same options and process is used by the deployment target and the deployment step.
