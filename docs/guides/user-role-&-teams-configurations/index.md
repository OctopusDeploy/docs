Octopus deploy has a fine grained authorization mechanism that allows you to configure the access to your deployment server in just the right way to suit your organisation. To provide the right access to the right people you may need to create your own custom Roles and Teams to assign to your users. Although actually [Managing users and teams](/docs/administration/managing-users-and-teams/index.md) requires only a few steps, often it can be confusing deciding exactly how it should be all structured. These guides aim to show you how you might configure your permissions in several different auth scenarios.
