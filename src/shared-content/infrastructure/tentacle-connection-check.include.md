To help with diagnostics, we've include a welcome page you can connect to from your web browser. 

When you conduct these checks:

- If you're presented with a prompt to "confirm a certificate" or "select a certificate" choose "Cancel" - don't provide one.
- If you're presented with a warning about the invalidity of the site's certificate, "continue to the site" or "add an exception" (Octopus Server uses a self-signed certificate by default).
