## Add new environments {#add-new-environments}

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure âžœ Environments** and click **ADD ENVIRONMENT**.
1. Give your new environment a meaningful name and click **SAVE**. You can click on the Development, Test, or Production links in the help text to choose that name.

You can add as many environments as you need, and you can reuse your environments with different projects so there's no need to create environments per project.

:::div{.hint}
In general, keep the number of environments under ten. Having fewer environments makes configuring and maintaining your Octopus Server easier.
