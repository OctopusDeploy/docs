## Uninstall Tentacles

If you get to the end of this guide without success, it can be worthwhile to completely remove the Tentacle configuration, data, and working folders, and then reconfigure it from scratch. This can be done without any impact to the applications you have deployed. Learn about [manually uninstalling Tentacle](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/tentacle-configuration-and-file-storage/manually-uninstall-tentacle). Working from a clean slate can sometimes expose the underlying problem.
