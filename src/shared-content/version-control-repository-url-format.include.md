Different VCS providers require different URL formats for the Git repository, some (e.g. GitLab) require the URL include `.git` at the end while others (e.g. Azure DevOps) does not support this. GitHub supports either format.

The best option to get the correct URL is to go to the repository in your provider and copy the URL used for cloning the repository from there.
