Listening Tentacles require no special configuration for Octopus High Availability. Polling Tentacles and Kubernetes agents, however, poll a server at regular intervals to check if there are any tasks waiting for the Tentacle to perform. In a High Availability scenario Polling Tentacles must poll all of the Octopus Server nodes in your configuration. To configure the Kubernetes agent with Octopus High Availability, see [Kubernetes agent HA Cluster Support](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/kubernetes/kubernetes-agent/ha-cluster-support).
