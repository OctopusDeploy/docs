We recommend starting with either 2 cores / 4 GB of RAM or 4 cores / 8 GB of RAM and limiting the task cap to 20 for each node.  In our experience, it is much better to have 4 smaller VMs, each with 4 cores / 8 GB of RAM than 2 large VMs, each with 8 cores / 16 GB of RAM.  With 2 servers, if one of them were to go down, you'd lose 50% of your capacity.  With 4 servers, if one of them were to go down, you'd lose 25% of your capacity.  The difference in cost between the 4 smaller VMs and 2 large VMs is typically minimal.
