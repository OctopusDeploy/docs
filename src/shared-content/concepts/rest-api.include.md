Octopus Deploy is built **API-first**. This means that Octopus is built in layers; all data and operations are available over its REST API. The Octopus Web Portal is built on top of this API so all of the data and operations you can see and perform in the Octopus Web Portal can be performed over the REST API.

Octopus integrates with build servers, scripts, external applications, and anything else with its REST API.
