We built Octopus Deploy API-first. This means that Octopus is built in layers. All data and operations are available over its REST API. We built the Octopus Web Portal on top of this API, so all the data and operations you can see and perform in the Octopus Web Portal, you can perform over the REST API.

Octopus connects to build servers, scripts, external applications, and anything else with its REST API.
