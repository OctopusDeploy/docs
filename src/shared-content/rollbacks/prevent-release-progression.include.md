Blocking Release Progression is an optional step to add to your rollback process.  [The Block Release Progression](https://library.octopus.com/step-templates/78a182b3-5369-4e13-9292-b7f991295ad1/actiontemplate-block-release-progression) step template uses the API to [prevent the rolled back release from progressing](/docs/releases/prevent-release-progression).

This step includes the following parameters:

- Octopus Url: #{Octopus.Web.BaseUrl} (default value)
- Octopus API Key: API Key with permissions to block releases
- Release Id to Block: #{Octopus.Release.CurrentForEnvironment.Id} (default value)
- Reason: This can be pulled from a manual intervention step or set to `Rolling back to #{Octopus.Release.Number}`

This step will only run on a rollback; set the run condition for this step to:

```
#{Octopus.Action[Calculate Deployment Mode].Output.RunOnRollback}
```

To unblock that release, go to the release page and click the **UNBLOCK** button.
