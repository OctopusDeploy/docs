Octopus Cloud is hosted in the following Azure regions:

- `West US 2` 
- `West Europe` 
- `Australia East`

We have plans to bring more regions online as demand for instances grows. If you'd like to move an existing Octopus Cloud instance to one of the other regions, or if you want to request a new region, please [contact us](https://octopus.com/company/contact).
