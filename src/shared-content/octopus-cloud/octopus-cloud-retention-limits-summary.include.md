We impose [storage limits](/docs/octopus-cloud/#octopus-cloud-storage-limits) on your instance to keep your file consumption and database size as small as possible.

- All lifecycle retention policies have a default of `30 Days` instead of forever.
- The internal package feed retention policy is also defaulted to `30 Days`.

Professional instances can change these limits.
