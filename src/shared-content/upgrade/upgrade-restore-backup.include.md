### Restore backup of database

Use SQL Server Management Studio's (SSMS) built-in restore backup functionality.  SSMS provides a wizard to make this process as pain-free as possible.  Be sure to consult a DBA or read up on [Microsoft's Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-database-to-a-new-location-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15).
