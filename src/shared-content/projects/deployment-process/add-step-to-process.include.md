## Adding steps to your deployment processes

1. Navigate to your [project](/docs/projects).
2. Click the **Create process** button.
3. Find the step template you need and click **Add step**.

At this point, you have the choice of choosing from the built-in **Installed Step Templates** or the [Community Contributed Step Templates](/docs/projects/community-step-templates).

If you're looking for example deployments, see the [deployment examples](/docs/deployments#getting-started-with-deployments).

4. Give the step a short memorable name.
5. The **Execution Location** tells the step where to run. Depending on the type of step you are configuring the options will vary:

   - [Worker pool](/docs/infrastructure/workers/worker-pools)
   - Worker pool on behalf of roles
   - Deployment targets

6. If you are deploying to deployment targets or running the step on the server on behalf of deployment targets, you can deploy to all targets in parallel (default) or configure a rolling deployment. To configure a rolling deployment click *Configure a rolling deployment* and specify the window size for the deployment. The window size controls how many deployment targets will be deployed to in parallel.

Learn more about [rolling deployments](/docs/deployments/patterns/rolling-deployments-with-octopus).

7. The next section of the step is where you specify the actions for the step to take. If you are running a script or deploying a package, this is where you provide the details. This section will vary depending on the type of step you're configuring. If you're deploying packages you'll likely need to set your [configuration variables](/docs/projects/steps/configuration-features/xml-configuration-variables-feature).
8. After providing the actions the steps takes, you can set the conditions for the step. You can set the following conditions:

   - Only run the step when deploying to specific environments.
   - Only run the step when deploying a release through a specific [channel](/docs/releases/channels).
   - Set the step to run depending on the status of the previous step.
   - Set when package acquisition should occur.
   - Set whether or not the step is required.

Learn more about [conditions](/docs/projects/steps/conditions).

9.  Add additional steps.
10. Save the deployment process.

With your deployment process configured you're ready to create a [release](/docs/releases).
