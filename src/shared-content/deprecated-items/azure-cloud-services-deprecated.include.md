Azure [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates/deprecating-service-management-apis-support-for-azure-app-service/) that from June 30th 2018 support for Service Management API (which indicates Cloud Services) would be retired. Azure stated at the time that _"Cloud Services is similar to Service Fabric in degree of control versus ease of use, but it's now a legacy service and Service Fabric is recommended for new development"_ 

We recommend reading the Azure [guide to choosing a compute service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree) to help choose a replacement you can [deploy to Azure](/docs/deployments/azure) with.

This guide remains here for legacy applications.

Support for this feature will be deprecated in Octopus Server from the `2024.1` release.
