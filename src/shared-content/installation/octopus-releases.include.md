From **Octopus 2020.6**, we ship a new release of Octopus Deploy Server once a quarter. Each release receives *six months support*, including critical patches. The releases are rolled out to Octopus Cloud instances before being made available to download for self-hosted instances of the Octopus Server.

We highly recommend using the latest release for your self-hosted installation of Octopus. Please see the [Octopus.com/downloads](https://octopus.com/downloads) page to download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.

For more details about the changes to the way we release Octopus, check out the blog post [Octopus releases and Long Term Support (LTS)](https://octopus.com/blog/releases-and-lts).
