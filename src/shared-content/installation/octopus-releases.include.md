Each self-hosted major.minor release of Octopus Deploy will receive critical patches and support for a period of six months.  For example, 2025.4 was released in December 2025 and will be supported for six months.

All new releases of Octopus Deploy will run in Octopus Cloud first for at least one quarter.  As a result, Octopus Cloud is always at least one version ahead of the self-hosted version.

Because of that, we always recommend using the latest available release for your self-hosted installation of Octopus. Please see the [Octopus.com/downloads](https://octopus.com/downloads) to download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.

For more details, please refer to our [blog post announcement from 2020](https://octopus.com/blog/releases-and-lts), when we introduced this release cadence.
