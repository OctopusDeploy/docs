This tutorial will help you complete your first runbook run using a sample script on one or more of your servers.  The only prerequisite is a running Octopus Deploy instance, either in Octopus Cloud or self-hosted.  The tutorial will walk through configuring deployment targets.

This tutorial will take between **15-25 minutes** to complete, with each step taking between **2-3** minutes to complete.

This tutorial will run a sample script, first on the default worker or your server; then, it will move onto running that script on your servers.  If you prefer to skip that and start configuring Octopus Deploy runbooks to meet your requirements, please see:
