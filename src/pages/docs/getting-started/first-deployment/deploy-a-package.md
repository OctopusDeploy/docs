Octopus Deploy's primary purpose is to push software packages, .zip, .jar, .war, .tar, .nupkg, etc., to your deployment targets.  Octopus Deploy requires all your assets, binaries, configuration files, CSS files, and more to run your application to be packaged up.  Typically this is done by your build server.

Packages must have the following attributes:

- Package ID. i.e., `hello-world`.
- Version number, i.e., `1.0.0`. 
- Package format, i.e., `.zip`.

To learn more about supported formats, versioning, and packaging applications, refer to the [packaging documentation](/docs/packaging-applications).

The following is a sample package that could be deployed with Octopus Deploy:

> [hello-world.1.0.0.zip](https://octopus.com/images/docs/hello-world.1.0.0.zip)

You can manually upload that package to the Octopus built-in repository in the Octopus Web Portal.

1. Navigating to the **Library** tab.
1. Click **UPLOAD PACKAGE**.
1. Select the package you want to upload and click **UPLOAD**.

Add a step to the hello world deployment process to push that package to the desired deployment target.

1. Click the **Projects** link in the top menu.
1. Select the **Hello World** project.
1. Click the **Process** link in the left menu.
1. Click the **ADD STEP** button.
1. Select the **Package** tile.
1. Click **ADD** on the **Deploy a Package** tile.
1. Leave the **Step Name** and the **Enabled** check-box as is.
1. Select *hello-world* as the **On Targets in Roles**.
1. Select *hello-world* as the **Package ID**.
1. Click the **SAVE** button.
