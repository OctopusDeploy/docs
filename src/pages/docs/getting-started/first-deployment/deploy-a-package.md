Deploying software with Octopus often involves deploying packages, for example, `.zip`, `.nupkg`, `.jar`, `.tar`, etc. In this section, we'll walk you through the steps to deploy a sample hello world package to your deployment target.

To learn about supported formats, versioning, and packaging applications, refer to the [packaging documentation](/docs/packaging-applications).

## Before your start

Please download our sample package:

- [hello-world.1.0.0.zip](https://octopus.com/images/docs/hello-world.1.0.0.zip)

## Upload package

1. From the left Deploy menu, click **Packages**.

2. Click **Upload Package**.
3. Select the package you want to upload.


## Add deploy package step

Add a step to the deployment process to push that package to your deployment target.

1. From the left Deploy menu, click **Projects**.
2. Select the **Hello world deployment** project.
3. Click **Process** in the left menu.
4. Click **Add Step**.
5. Select the **Package** category to filter the types of steps.
6. Locate the Deploy a Package card and click **Add Step**.

### Step name

You can leave this as the default *Deploy a Package*.

### Target tags

7. Select **tutorial-target** from the **Target Tags** dropdown list.

:::div{.hint}
**Context for target tags**

When configuring your deployment process, you can click a target tag to see the deployment targets and environments the step will run on.

### Package

8. Select **hello-world** from the **Package ID** dropdown list.

You can skip the other sections of this page for this tutorial.

**Save** your deployment process and you can move on to create and deploy a release.

## Release and deploy

1. Create a new release and deploy it to the Development environment.

The release will deploy the *hello world* package to the *Hello world tutorial target*.

You completed the first deployment tutorial, well done! ðŸŽ‰  

In this series you built a multi-step deployment process, used scoped variables, and deployed a sample package to a deployment target. It's now time to add your applications to Octopus Deploy.
