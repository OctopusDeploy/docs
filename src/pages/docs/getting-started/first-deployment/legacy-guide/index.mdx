This tutorial will help you complete your first deployment in Octopus Deploy.  It will walk through the steps to deploy a sample [hello world package](https://octopus.com/images/docs/hello-world.1.0.0.zip) to one or more of your servers.  The only prerequisite is a running Octopus Deploy instance, either in Octopus Cloud or self-hosted.  The tutorial assumes you have a brand new instance running and will walk through the rest of the setup, including configuring deployment targets.

This tutorial will take between **25-35 minutes** to complete, with each step taking between **2-5** minutes to complete.

2. [Create a project](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/legacy-guide/create-projects)
3. [Define the deployment process](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/legacy-guide/define-the-deployment-process)
4. [Create a release and deploy it](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/legacy-guide/create-and-deploy-a-release)
5. [Define and use variables](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/define-and-use-variables)
6. [Approvals with manual interventions](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/approvals-with-manual-interventions)
