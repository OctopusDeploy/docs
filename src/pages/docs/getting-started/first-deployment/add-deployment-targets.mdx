With Octopus, you can deploy software to:

- Kubernetes
- Windows
- Linux
- Azure
- AWS
- Offline package drop
- Cloud region

Regardless of where you’re deploying your software, these machines and services are known as your deployment targets.

## Add deployment target

1. From the left Deploy menu, click **Deployment Targets**.

:::

2. Click **Add Deployment Target**.
3. Use the category tabs to filter by deployment target type.
4. Click **Add** on the deployment target you want to add.

### Name

Give your deployment target a descriptive name, for example, `Hello world tutorial target`.

### Environments

We’ll scope this deployment target to one environment. Later, you can add additional targets and scope them to your other environments.

5. Select **Development** from the **Environments** dropdown list.

### Target Tags

Octopus uses target tags to select which deployment target a project should deploy to. Later, you’ll add the same target tag to your deployment process. You can deploy to multiple targets simply by adding this tag.

6. Add a new target tag by typing it into the field. For this example, we’ll use `tutorial-target`.

- [Offline package drop](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/offline-package-drop)
- [Cloud region](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/cloud-regions)

Next, let’s [deploy a sample package](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/deploy-a-package) to your deployment target.
