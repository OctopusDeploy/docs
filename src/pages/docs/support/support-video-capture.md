navOrder: 1
---

When you contact Octopus Deploy support with an issue, we'll sometimes ask you to use our screen capture app to display the issue, so that we can understand what went wrong. This page explains how to capture this information.

If you have a mic and would like to narrate the issue during the screen capture, you can give the application permission to do so.

Details on the app and the data usage:
1. Recordings sent to Octopus will be used for diagnostic purposes only, and will not be shared externally from Octopus in any way.
2. All recordings will be sent to an encrypted and secure Azure blob container.
3. All recordings will be deleted 30 days from the time of upload via retention policy and can be manually deleted  upon request.
4. Only the Octopus support team has direct access to the recording files. The files may be shared with other internal teams if required during an issue escalation.

Browsers may behave differently when granting permissions and capturing. If the review box is blank then neither audio or video was captured.
