Octopus Deploy can help you perform repeatable and controlled deployments of your applications into Azure.

Out-of-the-box, Octopus provides built-in steps to deploy to the following Azure products:

- [Azure Web applications](/docs/deployments/azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-web-app/) and [web jobs](/docs/deployments/azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-web-app/deploying-web-jobs) (also works for [Azure Functions](https://octopus.com/blog/azure-functions)).
- [Resource Group Templates](/docs/runbooks/runbook-examples/azure/resource-groups).
- [Azure Cloud Services](/docs/deployments/azure/cloud-services).
- [Service Fabric](/docs/deployments/azure/service-fabric).
- [Executing PowerShell scripts using the Azure cmdlets](/docs/deployments/custom-scripts/azure-powershell-scripts/). Follow our guide on [running Azure PowerShell scripts](/docs/deployments/azure/running-azure-powershell).

With [runbooks](/docs/runbooks), Octopus provides built-in steps to help manage your infrastructure in Azure:

:::div{.hint}
**Where do Azure steps execute?**
All steps that target an Azure deployment target (including script steps) execute on a worker.  By default, that will be the built-in worker in the Octopus Server. Learn about [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers) and the different configuration options.
