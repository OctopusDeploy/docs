Octopus Deploy makes it easy to manage your Kubernetes resources, whether you're starting simple or want complete control over a complex setup. This section has everything you need to know about using Octopus for Kubernetes CD.

## Why use Octopus as your Kubernetes CD platform
- Model environments and tenants for hundreds of applications with ease.
- Work with any Kubernetes distribution in the cloud or on-premises. Source YAML or Helm charts from Git or repositories.
- Use the centralized dashboard and detailed resource status to learn the state of all your deployments and clusters in an instant.
- Use configuration templates across environments, tenants, or even applications.
- Automate routine maintenance and respond faster to emergencies:
  - Octopus [runbooks](https://octopus.com/docs/runbooks/) and [projects](https://octopus.com/docs/projects) share the same variables and accounts to interact with your clusters
  - Use pre-approved [kubectl](https://octopus.com/docs/deployments/kubernetes/kubectl) scripts

## Getting started
With Octopus, you can choose between managing your application configuration with Helm charts or YAML.

## First production deployment
When youâ€™re ready to apply Octopus to a real scenario, we recommend that you:
- Familiarize yourself with 3 fundamental Octopus concepts: [projects](https://octopus.com/docs/projects), [environments](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/environments), and [targets](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets). When you have time, you can learn about other Octopus concepts in our [glossary](https://octopus.com/docs/getting-started/glossary).
- Learn how to implement GitOps best practices with Octopus and use our observability features.
