Deploying software with Octopus Deploy involves [packaging your applications](/docs/packaging-applications/) and [configuring your infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/). With those two completed, you define your [deployment process](/docs/projects/deployment-process/) by creating a [project](/docs/projects/), adding [steps](/docs/projects/steps/),  [configuration variables](/docs/projects/variables/), and creating [releases](/docs/releases).

When you deploy a release, you execute the deployment process with all the included assets as they existed when the release was created.
