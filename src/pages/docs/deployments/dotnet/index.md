.NET is Microsoft's popular, free, cross-platform, open source developer platform. With it, you can build a variety of applications. It comes in three flavors:

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) (also known as .NET Core) for when you want your applications to be cross-platform. Suitable for websites, servers and command-line applications to run on Linux, Windows and macOS.
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet-framework) for websites, services, desktop applications targeting the Windows OS.
- [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin/what-is-xamarin) for mobile apps.

Octopus Deploy can help you perform repeatable, reliable deployments of your .NET applications, whichever implementation you use.
