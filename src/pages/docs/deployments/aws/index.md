Octopus Deploy includes dedicated integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help you achieve repeatable, recoverable, secure, and auditable deployments:

- [Deploy Amazon ECS Service](/docs/deployments/aws/ecs) is a UI-driven step with an opinionated deployment workflow that builds the CloudFormation template for you.
- [Deploy an AWS CloudFormation Template](/docs/deployments/aws/cloudformation) allows you to create or update a CloudFormation stack. It offers more flexibility than the UI step.
- [Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack](/docs/deployments/aws/removecloudformation) deletes existing CloudFormation stacks.
- [Upload a package to an AWS S3 bucket](/docs/deployments/aws/s3) allows you to upload files and packages to S3 buckets.
- [Run an AWS CLI Script](/docs/deployments/custom-scripts/aws-cli-scripts) runs a custom script with AWS credentials pre-loaded.

**Where do AWS Steps execute?**
All AWS steps execute on a worker. By default, that will be the [built-in worker](/docs/infrastructure/workers/#built-in-worker) in the Octopus Server. Learn about [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers) and the different configuration options.

## Get started with ECS or deploy a new service

The [Deploy Amazon ECS Service](/docs/deployments/aws/ecs) step makes it easier to get started or deploy a new service through Octopus.

The step guides you through the configuration of the task definition and service with built-in validation. Octopus generates and executes the CloudFormation templates, so you don't have to write any YAML or JSON.

With the UI step, you can:

- Monitor the deployment and service status, feedback, and error messages from Octopus. You don't need to open the AWS Console.
- Deploy updates to your containerized apps without changing the deployment process. Create a release with the new version, and Octopus updates the task definition and service for you.
- Set a timeout duration so you're not waiting hours to learn a deployment is stuck.

When you outgrow the guided UI step or need more flexibility, you can expose the underlying CloudFormation YAML and paste it into the [Deploy an AWS CloudFormation Template](/docs/deployments/aws/cloudformation) step. 

## Centralize and secure your ECS deployments with Octopus

Octopus offers a central platform to manage your AWS resources, including account credentials, ECS clusters, certificates, configuration, and scripts.

The ECS [deployment target](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/add-deployment-targets/) and steps integrate with other Octopus features, including [built-in AWS service accounts](/docs/infrastructure/accounts/aws/), [runbooks](/docs/runbooks/), [variables](/docs/projects/variables/), [channels](/docs/releases/channels/), and [lifecycles](/docs/releases/lifecycles).

Octopus projects and runbooks share the same variables and accounts, making it easier to capture shared procedures, automate routine maintenance and respond quickly to emergencies.

Flexible, [role-based security](/docs/security/users-and-teams/user-roles/) allows you to decide who can deploy to production and trigger runbooks against specific clusters. You can view the history of significant events and changes in the Octopus [audit log](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing).
