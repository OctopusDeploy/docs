Certificates can be downloaded from Octopus to your local machine.  The certificate may be exported in any of the [supported file-formats](/docs/deployments/certificates), or exactly as it was originally uploaded.

## Private-keys

If the certificate includes a private-key, then user requires the _Export certificate private-keys_ permission to download the certificate in a format which includes the private-key.

Exporting a certificate with a private-key will be [audited](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing).
