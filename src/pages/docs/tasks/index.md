Many of the main operations Octopus performs are represented by Tasks. This includes all deployments and runbook runs, and system operations such as applying retention policies. Since Tasks consume resources on the Octopus Server while they are executing, the number of Tasks which can execute at the same time is limited by a task cap. See [increasing the task cap](/docs/support/increase-the-octopus-server-task-cap) for more information.
