The Compliance Dashboard is new to Platform Hub. Today, you can already access auditing information via the [Audit](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing) tab in the Configuration area and SIEM tools by leveraging our [audit stream](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing/audit-stream) capabilities.

We are focused on making it even easier to get to the information Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) teams are looking for. To start with, we are building reports to answer two questions:

1. **Deployment Permissions**: Which users have permissions to deploy projects and to which environments?
2. **Production Deployments**: Who deployed to Production and when did those deployments occur?

Find out more about our [Compliance reports](/docs/platform-hub/compliance/reports).
