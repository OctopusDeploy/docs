The Compliance Dashboard is a new addition to the Platform Hub, designed to transform raw audit data into actionable insights.

While you can already access granular logs via the [Audit](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing) tab or integrate with SIEM tools using the [audit stream](/docs/security/users-and-teams/auditing/audit-stream), the Compliance Dashboard streamlines reporting for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) teams.

Our initial reports focus on answering two critical questions:

1. **Deployment Permissions**: Which users are authorized to deploy specific projects, and to which environments?
2. **Production Deployments**: Who initiated deployments to Production, and when did those events occur?

Explore our available [Compliance reports](/docs/platform-hub/compliance/reports) to get started.
