## How to install a pre-release version of Octopus server

Self-hosted customers can install a pre-release version of Octopus Server containing Process Templates and Policies from September 30. Please visit this page on September 30 for a download and installation guide.

:::div{.warning}
You should only install a pre-release version of Octopus server if you are comfortable with adopting a feature that isn't fully complete. Any issues or bugs you encounter will **not** be fixed immediately. Please reach out to <sales@octopus.com> for any queries on whether this approach is right for you.
