Platform Hub is a new capability in Octopus that helps platform teams standardize how software is delivered across teams using connected templates and enforceable policies. Together, these features create a governance layer for software delivery, making it easier for platform teams to scale best practices, reduce drift, and deliver with confidence. Our first feature is [Policies](policies/index.md), with more coming soon.

You can create and manage your policies from Platform Hub.

- [Policies](/docs/platform-hub) in Octopus are designed to ensure compliance and governance by default, making it easier to enforce pre- and post-deployment controls at scale.

To get started, configure your version control, and then follow [our guide](policies/index.md)to create your first policy.
