[Platform Hub](https://octopus.com/blog/introducing-platform-hub) is a new capability in Octopus that helps platform teams standardize how software is delivered across teams using connected templates and enforceable policies. Together, these features create a governance layer for software delivery, making it easier for platform teams to scale best practices, reduce drift, and deliver with confidence.

:::div{.warning}
- Policies is currently in Alpha for all Enterprise Tier Customers. The feature is not finished or fully tested, and may change drastically as we iterate and build more functionality.
- Process Templates is in Public Preview for all Enterprise Tier Customers. The feature is mostly complete, and mostly tested. Expect some changes between Public Preview and the Generally Available release.
:::

You can create and manage your process templates and policies from Platform Hub.

- [Process templates](/docs/platform-hub/process-templates) are reusable sets of deployment steps that can be shared across multiple spaces in Octopus Deploy
- [Policies](/docs/platform-hub/policies) in Octopus are designed to ensure compliance and governance by default, making enforcing pre- and post-deployment controls at scale easier.

To get started, configure your version control.
