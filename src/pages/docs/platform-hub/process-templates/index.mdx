Process templates help you standardize delivery across teams and applications without duplicating work. Developers move faster with less cognitive load, and platform teams get the consistency they need
Process templates help you:

- Create standardized deployment processes that any application engineer can pick up and use in their project
- Let people self-serve best practice deployment processes
- Easily update standard deployment processes with minimal work from you and your team
