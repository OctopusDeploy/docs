description: Using Process Templates in Octopus

---

Process templates let you standardize delivery across teams and applications without duplicating work. Developers move faster with less cognitive load, and platform teams get the consistency they need.

Each process template contains deployment steps that represent common deployment patterns that multiple teams use. Application teams can use process templates in any project for deployments or runbooks runs, continuously receiving updates as they are published.

## When to use Process Templates

Process templates help you:

- Create standardized deployment processes that any application engineer can pick up and use in their project
- Let people self-serve best practice deployment processes
- Easily update standard deployment processes with minimal work from you and your team

Consider using Process Templates if:

- You have common deployment patterns across teams and need to make it easy to standardise on these best practices.
- You want to make it easy for application teams to onboard and use best practice deployment patterns in Octopus.
- You want to reduce the amount of maintenance it takes to keep deployment processes up to date with the latest changes.
