## Setting up process templates

To create or manage your process templates, navigate to the Platform Hub in the Octopus UI. If you've already created templates, or are joining an existing team, you'll see the existing templates in the template overview screen.

## Add a template

Before you can define your deployment process for your template, you must create the template first.

1. Navigate to the **Add template button** in the Octopus UI
2. Give the process template a **NAME** and an optional **DESCRIPTION**
3. Click **ADD** in the Octopus UI

Now that you've created your process template, you can define your deployment process. All templates are stored in the connected Git repo. Any changes made in the Git repo will be reflected in Platform Hub in the process template

## Process template settings

You can change the settings of the process template by accessing the settings tab on the process template. The settings you can change are:

- Name
- Description
- Icon
