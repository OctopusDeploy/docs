This section will provide a set of best practices and implementation guides to use with your Octopus Deploy instance.  Like any best practices guide, it won't cover 100% of all scenarios; adapt and modify them to match your company's requirements.  It is also a living document; it will change as new features are added to Octopus Deploy and we help more customers.
