Reason about what changes have been deployed where, to help you understand what your customers are using in production.

### 📝 Prompt

```
Customer X have submitted a support ticket complaining that there is a bug in the latest release of App. Can you tell me what release they are on, when it was deployed, and if there were any issues with the deployment?
```

Get to the root cause of failures or unhealthy deployment targets, allowing you to more quickly recover from failures.

Example: Check for failed deployments or unhealthy kubernetes workloads, analyze the failure reasons and suggest solutions.
