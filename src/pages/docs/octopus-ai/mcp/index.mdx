### Octopus MCP Server

The Octopus MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) server represents a significant leap forward in AI integration capabilities. Built on Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools, the MCP server enables AI assistants like Claude to interact directly with your Octopus Deploy infrastructure.

The Octopus MCP server provides similar capabilities to the Octopus AI Assistant, but provides further benefits:

- You can use it with your client and model of choice.
- It can work alongside other MCP servers to accomplish more complex orchestrations across Octopus and your other essential software services.

The MCP server provides tools designed to solve key use-cases within change management, troubleshooting, administration audit & compliance, and standardization at scale.

The MCP server architecture ensures that your deployment data remains secure while enabling powerful AI-assisted workflows. All interactions are logged and auditable, maintaining the compliance and governance standards your organization requires.

The Octopus MCP Server is open source, and anyone can contribute to it. It is available for free on Github at [https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/mcp-server](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/mcp-server)

## Security

The Octopus MCP Server works by communicating with your Octopus instance's REST API via a secure HTTPS connection. It leverages Octopus Server's existing API Key security mechanism, ensuring all interactions are authenticated, authorized for the permissions associated with the API Key, and audited.

To learn more, read our [Octopus REST API](/docs/octopus-rest-api) documentation.

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js >= v20.0.0
- Octopus Deploy instance that can be accessed by the MCP server via HTTPS
- Octopus Deploy API Key

### Configuration

Full example configuration (for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octopusdeploy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@octopusdeploy/mcp-server", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY", "--server-url", "https://your-octopus.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Octopus MCP Server is typically configured within your AI Client of choice. 

It is packaged as an npm package and executed via Node's `npx` command. Your configuration will include the command invocation `npx`, and a set of arguments that supply the Octopus MCP Server package and provide the Octopus Server URL and API key required, if they are not available as environment variables.

The command line invocation you will be configuring will be one of the two following variants:

```bash
npx -y @octopusdeploy/mcp-server
```

With configuration provided via environment variables:
```bash
OCTOPUS_API_KEY=API-KEY
OCTOPUS_SERVER_URL=https://your-octopus.com
```

Or with configuration supplied via the command line:
```bash
npx -y @octopusdeploy/mcp-server --server-url https://your-octopus.com --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```
