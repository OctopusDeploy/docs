AI, especially GenAI, is reshaping software delivery. At Octopus, we harness it to accelerate recovery time from failure, to reduce the burden of administration and audit, and to improve the productivity of DevOps engineers.

Octopus AI spans three complementary areas, each designed to address different aspects of your deployment lifecycle - from interactive assistance and troubleshooting to fully autonomous DevOps operations.

## Getting Started

Begin your AI-powered DevOps journey today with the [Octopus AI Assistant](/docs/octopus-ai/assistant), or the [Octopus MCP Server](/docs/octopus-ai/mcp). As an Early Access participant, you'll help shape these features while gaining early access to capabilities that will transform how teams deploy software.

## Security and Privacy

All AI capabilities in Octopus Deploy are built with security and privacy as foundational principles. We never use customer data to train AI models, all sensitive values remain protected through our existing security model, and AI features respect your current permission boundaries. The AI Assistant backend is [open source](https://github.com/OctopusSolutionsEngineering/OctopusCopilot) and has been independently audited, with results available through our [trust center](https://trust.octopus.com/).

## Next Under Consideration

### Octopus AI Recovery Agent

One of the most important aspects of continuous delivery is being able to rapidly recover when something goes wrong. There are many tools that can be used to boost recovery - feature toggles, blue/green deployments, canary deployments, rollbacks. A short mean time to recovery is the hallmark of an elite software delivery engine.

Our AI assistant and our MCP server can help you understand the cause of failure, and suggest corrective actions that should get you back on track. But you are still in control, and need to be in the drivers seat making recovery happen.
