This page describes how to run Octopus Server in the Linux Container.

**Note:** When using Linux containers on a Windows machine, please ensure you have [switched to Linux Containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

## Getting started

Although there are a few different configuration options, the following is a simple example of starting the  Octopus Server Linux container:

```bash
$ docker run --interactive --detach --name OctopusDeploy --publish 1322:8080 --env ACCEPT_EULA="Y" --env DB_CONNECTION_STRING="..." octopusdeploy/octopusdeploy
```

- We run in detached mode with `--detach` to allow the container to run in the background.
- The `--interactive` argument ensures that `STDIN` is kept open, which is required since this is what the running `Octopus.Server.exe` process is waiting on to close.
- Setting `--name OctopusServer` gives us an easy-to-remember name for this container. This is optional, but we recommend you provide a name that is meaningful to you, as that will make it easier to perform actions on the container later if necessary.
- Using `--publish 1322:8080` maps the _container port_ `8080` to `1322` on the host so that the Octopus instance is accessible outside this server.
- To set the connection string we provide an _environment variable_ `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` (this can be a local or external database).

In this example, we run the image `octopusdeploy/octopusdeploy` without an explicit tag, running the `latest` version of Octopus Server that's been published to DockerHub.

## Running Octopus Server in a Container

This section walks through some of the different ways you can run the Octopus Server Linux Container, from `docker compose` to using a full orchestration service such as Kubernetes:

- [Octopus Server Container with Docker Compose](/docs/installation/octopus-server-linux-container/docker-compose-linux)
- [Octopus Server Container with systemd](/docs/installation/octopus-server-linux-container/systemd-service-definition)
- [Octopus Server Container in Kubernetes](/docs/installation/octopus-server-linux-container/octopus-in-kubernetes)

## Migration

You may already have Octopus Server running on Windows Server or in a Windows container you wish to run in a Linux Container. This section walks through the different options and considerations for migrating to an Octopus Server Linux Container. 

- [Migrate to Octopus Server Linux Container from Windows Server](/docs/installation/octopus-server-linux-container/migration/migrate-to-server-container-linux-from-windows-server)
- [Migrate to Octopus Server Linux Container from Windows Container](/docs/installation/octopus-server-linux-container/migration/migrate-to-server-container-linux-from-windows-container)

## Configuration

:::div{.hint}
Support for authentication providers differs depending on how you host Octopus Server. Please see our [authentication provider compatibility section](/docs/security/authentication/auth-provider-compatibility) to ensure any existing authentication provider is supported when running Octopus in a Linux Container.
:::

When running an Octopus Server Image, you can supply the following values to configure the running Octopus Server instance.

### Master Key

If you do not specify a master key when Octopus is first run, Octopus will generate one for you, which you must pass as the `MASTER_KEY` environment variable with each subsequent run. However, it is also possible to create your own master key for Octopus to use when configuring the database.

Master keys must be a 128 bit string encoded in base 64. You can generate a random string to use as the master key with the command:

```
openssl rand 16 | base64
```

### Environment variables

Read the Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file) about setting environment variables.

|  Name       |    |
| ------------- | ------- |
|**DB_CONNECTION_STRING**|Connection string to the database to use|
|**MASTER_KEY**|The Master Key to connect to an existing database. If not supplied, and the database does not exist, it will generate a new one. The Master Key is mandatory if the database exists.|
|**OCTOPUS_SERVER_BASE64_LICENSE**|Your license key for Octopus Deploy. If left empty, it will try to create a free license key for use
|**ADMIN_USERNAME**|The admin user to create for the Octopus Server|
|**ADMIN_PASSWORD**|The password for the admin user for the Octopus Server|
|**ADMIN_EMAIL**|The email associated with the admin user account|
|**TASK_CAP**|Sets the task cap for this node. If not specified, the default is 5.|
|**DISABLE_DIND**|The Linux image will by default attempt to run Docker-in-Docker to support [execution containers for workers](/docs/projects/steps/execution-containers-for-workers). This requires the image to be launched with [privileged permissions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities). Setting `DISABLE_DIND` to `Y` prevents Docker-in-Docker from being run when the container is booted.|

### Exposed container ports

Read Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish-or-expose-port--p---expose) about exposing ports.

|  Port       |    |
| ------------- | ------- |
|**8080**| Port for API and HTTP portal |
|**443**| SSL Port for API and HTTP portal |
|**10943**|Port for Polling Tentacles to contact the server|


### Volume mounts

Read the Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only) about mounting volumes.

| Name     | Description | Mount source |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | 
|**/import**| Imports from this folder if [Octopus Migrator](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus.migrator.exe-command-line) metadata.json exists, then migrator `Import` takes place on startup | Host filesystem or container |
|**/repository**| Package path for the built-in package repository | Shared storage |
|**/artifacts**| Path where artifacts are stored | Shared storage |
|**/taskLogs**| Path where task logs are stored | Shared storage |
|**/eventExports**| Path where event audit logs are exported | Shared storage |
|**/cache**| Path where cached files e.g., signature and delta files (used for package acquisition), are stored | Host filesystem or container |

:::div{.hint}
**Note:** We recommend using shared storage when mounting the volumes for files that must be shared between multiple octopus container nodes, e.g., artifacts, packages, task logs, and event exports.
:::

## Upgrading

When the volumes are externally mounted to the host filesystem, upgrades between Octopus versions are much easier. We can picture the upgrade process with a container as being similar to [moving a standard Octopus Server](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/moving-your-octopus/move-the-database-and-server) since containers, being immutable, don't themselves get updated.

Similar to moving an instance, to perform the container upgrade, you will need the Master Key you used to set up the original database. You can find the Master Key for an Octopus Server in a container with the container exec command:

```
> docker container exec <container name/ID> /Octopus/Octopus.Server show-master-key --console --instance OctopusServer

5qJcW9E6B99teMmrOzaYNA==
```

When you have the Master Key, you can stop the running Octopus Server container instance (delete it if you plan on using the same name) and run _almost_ the same command as before, but this time, pass in the Master Key as an environment variable and reference the new Octopus Server version. When this new container starts up, it will use the same credentials and detect that the database has already been set up and use the Master Key to access its sensitive values:

```bash
$ docker run --interactive --detach --name OctopusServer --publish 1322:8080 --env DB_CONNECTION_STRING="..." --env MASTER_KEY "5qJcW9E6B99teMmrOzaYNA==" octopusdeploy/octopusdeploy
```

The standard backup and restore procedures for the [data stored on the filesystem](/docs/administration/data/backup-and-restore/#octopus-file-storage) and the connected [SQL Server](/docs/administration/data) still apply as per regular Octopus installations.
