Octopus Deploy stores projects, environments, and deployment history in a Microsoft SQL Server Database.

## Using SQL Server Express \{#using-sql-express}

The easiest and cheapest way to get started is with [SQL Server Express](http://downloadsqlserverexpress.com/) and install the Octopus Server and SQL Server Express side-by-side on your server. This is a great way to test Octopus for a proof of concept. Depending on your needs, you can use SQL Server Express or upgrade to another supported edition.

## Creating the database

The Octopus [installation](/docs/installation/) wizard can create the database for you (our recommended method), during the installation; however, you can also point Octopus to an existing database. Octopus works with both local and remote database servers, but it is worth considering the [performance implications](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/performance) before deciding.

If you use a hosted database service, you must [create your database](#create-your-own) and provide Octopus with the connection details.

## Create your own database \{#create-your-own}

If you don't want Octopus to automatically create the database for you as part of the installation process, please note the following:

1. You must not share the database with any other application.
1. The default schema must be **dbo**.
1. The database must use a **case-insensitive collation** (a collation with a name containing "\_CI\_").
1. If you are using **Integrated Authentication** to connect to your database:
    - The user account installing Octopus must be a member of the **db\_owner** role for that database.
    - The account the Octopus Deploy windows server process runs under (by default, the `Local System` account) must be a member of the **db\_owner** role for that database.
1. If you are using **SQL Authentication** to connect to your database, the SQL user account defined in your connection string must be a member of the **db\_owner** role for that database.

## Changing the database collation

Learn more about [changing the database collation after the initial Octopus installation](/docs/administration/data/changing-octopus-database-collation).

## Using SQL Server AlwaysOn

Octopus will work with [any of the supported highly available SQL Server implementations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/high-availability-solutions-sql-server).

Make sure the Octopus Server is connecting to the listener, which will route database requests to the active SQL Server node and allow for automatic failover. Learn about [connecting to listeners and handling failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/listeners-client-connectivity-application-failover).

A typical connection string for using a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group looks like this:

```
Server=tcp:AGListener,1433;Database=Octopus;IntegratedSecurity=SSPI;MultiSubnetFailover=True
```

## Using Azure Active Directory (AAD) in Azure SQL \{#using-aad-in-azure-sql}

Support for [Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/azure-active-directory-authentication?view=sql-server-ver15#setting-azure-active-directory-authentication) was added in Octopus **2021.1**. This includes the ability to use a [Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/azure-active-directory-authentication?view=sql-server-ver15#using-active-directory-managed-identity-authentication) when connecting to your Octopus database hosted in Azure SQL.

A typical connection string for using Azure Active Directory Authentication with a Managed Identity looks like this:

```
Server=localhost;Initial catalog=Octopus;authentication="Active Directory Managed Identity"
```
