To distribute traffic to the Octopus web portal on multiple nodes, you need to use a HTTP load balancer. AWS provides a solution to distribute HTTP/HTTPS traffic to EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing is a highly available, secure, and elastic load balancer. There are three implementations of ELB;

* [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
* [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)
* [Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html)

If you are *only* using [Listening Tentacles](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/tentacle/tentacle-communication/#listening-tentacles-recommended), we recommend using the Application Load Balancer.

However, [Polling Tentacles](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/tentacle/tentacle-communication/#polling-tentacles) don't work well with the Application Load Balancer, so instead, we recommend using the Network Load Balancer. To setup a Network Load Balancer for Octopus High Availability with Polling Tentacles take a look at this [knowledge base article](https://help.octopus.com/t/how-can-i-configure-my-polling-tentacles-to-hit-my-octopus-deploy-high-availability-instance-to-sitting-behind-an-aws-load-balancer/24890).
