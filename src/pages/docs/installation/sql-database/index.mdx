Octopus Deploy stores projects, environments, and deployment history in a Microsoft SQL Server Database.

## Using SQL Server Express \{#SQLServerDatabaseRequirements-UsingSQLServerExpress}

The easiest and cheapest way to get started is with [SQL Server Express](http://downloadsqlserverexpress.com/) and install the Octopus Server and SQL Server Express side-by-side on your server. This is a great way to test Octopus for a proof of concept. Depending on your needs, you might decide to use SQL Server Express, or upgrade to another supported edition.

## Configuration Guidelines

The SQL Database Octopus Deploy uses can be hosted on a local SQL Server, or one of the many cloud providers.  The requirements are: 

- Must be running SQL Server 2016+ or Azure SQL
- Be located in the same data center as the servers/container hosts that host Octopus Deploy.

This section provides configuration walkthroughs for the popular storage options our customers use.
