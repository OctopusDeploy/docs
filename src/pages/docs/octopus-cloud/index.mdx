Octopus Cloud is the hosted version of Octopus Deploy.

We designed Octopus Cloud and self-hosted Octopus to provide the same functionality. Octopus Cloud uses the same deployment automation server to define your deployment processes and runbooks and manage the releases of your software.

You can get started with Octopus Cloud for [free](https://octopus.com/start/cloud).

## Create an Octopus account \{#create-an-octopus-account}

An Octopus account lets you manage your instances of Octopus Cloud. You can register for you Octopus account at [Octopus.com/register](https://Octopus.com/register).

<OctopusAccount />

Now that you've created an Octopus account, you can create a new instance of Octopus Cloud.

## Create a cloud instance \{#create-a-cloud-instance}

<OctopusCloudInstance />

When the instance is ready, you will see it (and any other instances you have access to) the next time you log in to your Octopus account at [https://octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).

## Where is Octopus Cloud hosted \{#octopus-cloud-hosting-locations}

<OctopusCloudRegions />

## Octopus Cloud storage limits \{#octopus-cloud-storage-limits}

Octopus Cloud instances are subject to storage limits. Specifically:

<OctopusCloudStorageLimits />

Please see our [Cloud pricing FAQ](https://octopus.com/pricing/faq#are-there-any-storage-limits) for further details.

## Uploading packages to Octopus Cloud servers \{#uploading-packages-to-octopus-cloud-servers}

Factors such as geographical distance, network bandwidth, and network congestion may cause package uploads to your Octopus Cloud Server to take longer than expected.

If you are having difficulty uploading packages to your Octopus built-in package feed within the default timeout threshold, typically within 5 minutes, you might be affected by one or more of the factors mentioned above. In this case, you could try increasing the timeout threshold of the Octopus CLI or `nuget.exe` to a value that suits you. We also recommend using the Octopus CLI, **Octopus.Client**, or the **TeamCity Plugin (v4.41.0+)** because they have the advantage of using delta compression.

## Change your password \{#change-your-password}

To change your password for the Octopus instance and Octopus account:

1. Go to [Octopus.com/signin](https://Octopus.com/signin).
1. Click the drop-down menu next to your username in the top right corner.
1. Click profile.
1. Click the **Change Password** link.
1. Enter your new password.
1. Confirm the new password, and click **Change password**.

## Reset the Octopus account password \{#reset-the-octopus-account-password}

If you forget your username or password for your Octopus account or Octopus instance, you can reset them via Octopus.com

1. Visit [Octopus.com/signin](https://Octopus.com/signin).
1. Click **Forgot your password?**
1. Reset your credentials and log into your Octopus account. You can now launch your Octopus instance from the accounts dashboard.

## Invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#inviting-octopus-cloud-users}

### Inviting users via Control Center

You can invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance from Control Center. To learn about how to invite users and the levels of access you can give them, head to the [Managing Octopus subscriptions](/docs/getting-started/managing-octopus-subscriptions#access-control) page.

### Managing User Permissions in Octopus Cloud

Users are only added to the Octopus Cloud instance after they sign in for the first time. After the first sign in, users get assigned to the **“Everyone”** team (if they’re a Cloud User) or the **“Octopus Managers”** team (if they’re a Cloud Owner). You can add users to different teams to give them appropriate permissions.

1. In the product, go to **Configuration**
1. Select **Teams**
1. Create or select an existing team such as **Space Managers**
1. Select **Add Member**
1. Click **Add** and then **Save**.

## Set the maintenance window \{#set-the-outage-window}

To keep Octopus Cloud running smoothly, we must perform occasional [maintenance](/docs/octopus-cloud/maintenance-window), including updates and optimizations on your instance.
Please pick a two-hour maintenance window in the control center.  Set a time outside of your normal business hours that is unlikely to include any scheduled deployments.  The daily two-hour window provides some scheduling flexibility to ensure that all of our Cloud instances can be kept up-to-date and in good health by running a variety of maintenance tasks.

1. Log in to your Octopus account.
1. Select your cloud instance.
1. Click Configuration.
1. Scroll down to Outage Window.
1. Select the time in UTC, providing a window of at least two hours and click **Save outage window**.

## Log in to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#log-in-to-your-octopus-cloud-instance}

You can access your Octopus Cloud instance at the URL you defined during the registration process. Where \<your-url\> is the part of the URL you provided:

https://\<your-url\>.octopus.app/app#/users/sign-in

## Octopus Cloud version \{#octopus-cloud-version}

We keep your instance of Octopus Cloud up to date and running the latest version of Octopus Deploy. To check which version your instance is running, log into the Octopus Web Portal, and click the drop-down menu that appears next to your name in the top right corner. The version is displayed at the top of the display.
