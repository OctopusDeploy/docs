description: Octopus Cloud includes permissions that relate to hosting Octopus itself, and not for the configuration of your instance, as that's managed by Octopus for you.
---

Your Octopus Cloud instance includes permissions that relate to hosting Octopus itself, and not for the configuration/usability of your instance (e.g. server configuration logs), so we've introduced a new built-in team called **Octopus Managers**, think of it as a **Cloud instance** admin.

The **Octopus Administrators** team is still present, but it's only used by our **octoadmin** account, and if you ask us to log in to your instance for support.

If you find there is something you think you ought to have access to as an **Octopus Manager**, but don't, please contact our [support team](https://octopus.com/support) and we can review the permissions.
