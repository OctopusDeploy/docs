## Create an Octopus account \{#create-an-octopus-account}
An Octopus account lets you manage your instances of Octopus Cloud. You can register for your Octopus account at [octopus.com/register](https://octopus.com/register).

You can sign up with your existing Google or Microsoft account or create a unique login for Octopus:

1. Enter your name.
2. Provide your email address and create a password.
3. On the next screen, verify your email address.
4. After your email has been verified, you’ll be logged into your Octopus account.

After you create an Octopus account, you can create a new instance of Octopus Cloud.

## Create a Cloud instance \{#create-a-cloud-instance}

To create a new instance of Octopus Cloud, make sure you’re logged in to your Octopus account:

1. Click **Create a new cloud instance**.
2. Enter the URL you’d like to use to access your instance: `your-url.octopus.app` . If the URL isn’t available, enter a different URL.
3. Select the region where you’d like to host your instance.
4. Add your company name.
5. Review the terms of our customer agreement, privacy policy, and acceptable usage policy.
6. Click **Agree, deploy my Octopus**!

You’ll be taken to the account provisioning screen. Your Octopus Cloud instance should be ready in a minute or so. You’ll receive an email when the instance is ready to use.

When the instance is ready, you’ll see it (and any other instances you have access to) the next time you log in to your Octopus account at [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).

## Uploading packages to Octopus Cloud servers \{#uploading-packages-to-octopus-cloud-servers}

Factors like geographical distance, network bandwidth, and network congestion may cause package uploads to your Octopus Cloud Server to take longer than expected.

If you’re having difficulty uploading packages to your Octopus built-in package feed in the default timeout threshold, typically within 5 minutes, you might be affected by one or more of the factors mentioned above. In this case, you can try increasing the timeout threshold of the Octopus CLI or nuget.exe to a value that suits you. We also recommend using the Octopus CLI, **Octopus.Client**, or the **TeamCity Plugin (v4.41.0+)** because they use delta compression.

## Change your password \{#change-your-password}

To change your password for the Octopus instance and Octopus account:
1. Go to [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click the drop-down menu next to your username in the top right corner.
3. Click **Profile**.
4. Click the **Change Password** link.
5. Enter your new password.
6. Confirm the new password, and click **Change password**.

## Reset the Octopus account password \{#reset-the-octopus-account-password}

If you forget your username or password for your Octopus account or instance, you can reset them via octopus.com.

1. Visit [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click **Forgot your password?**
3. Reset your credentials and log into your Octopus account. You can now launch your Octopus instance from the accounts dashboard.

## Invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#inviting-octopus-cloud-users}

### Inviting users via Control Center

You can invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance from the Control Center. To learn how to invite users and the levels of access you can give them, visit the [Managing Octopus subscriptions](https://octopus.com/docs/getting-started/managing-octopus-subscriptions#access-control) page.

### Managing user permissions in Octopus Cloud
Users are only added to the Octopus Cloud instance after they sign in for the first time. After the first sign in, users get assigned to the **“Everyone”** team (if they’re a Cloud User) or the **“Octopus Managers”** team (if they’re a Cloud Owner). You can add users to different teams to give them appropriate permissions.

1. In the product, go to **Configuration**.
2. Select **Teams**.
3. Create or select an existing team such as **Space Managers**.
4. Select **Add Member**.
5. Click **Add** and then **Save**.

## Set the maintenance window \{#set-the-maintenance-window}

To keep Octopus Cloud running smoothly, we must perform occasional [maintenance](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-cloud/maintenance-window), including updates and optimizations on your instance. 
Please pick a two-hour maintenance window in the control center. Set a time outside of your normal business hours that is unlikely to include any scheduled deployments. 

1. Log in to your Octopus account.
2. Select your cloud instance.
3. Click Configuration.
4. Scroll down to Maintenance Window.
5. Select the time in UTC, providing a window of at least 2 hours, and click Save maintenance window.

## Log in to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#log-in-to-your-octopus-cloud-instance}

You can access your Octopus Cloud instance at the URL you defined during the registration process. Where `your-url` is the part of the URL you provided:

```
https://your-url.octopus.app/app#/users/sign-in
```

## Find out the Octopus Cloud version \{#octopus-cloud-version}

We keep your instance of Octopus Cloud up-to-date and running the latest version of Octopus Deploy. To check which version your instance is running: 

1. Log into the Octopus Web Portal, and click the drop-down menu that appears next to your name in the top right corner. 
2. The version is shown at the top of the display.
