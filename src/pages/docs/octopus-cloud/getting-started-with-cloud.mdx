## Create an Octopus account \{#create-an-octopus-account}
An Octopus account lets you manage your Octopus Cloud instances. You can register for an account at [octopus.com/register](https://octopus.com/register).

You can sign up with your existing Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account, or create a unique login for Octopus:

1. Enter your name.
2. Provide your email address and create a password.
3. On the next screen, verify your email address.
4. After your email has been verified, you’ll be logged into your Octopus account.

After you create an Octopus account, you can create a new Octopus Cloud instance.

## Create a Cloud instance \{#create-a-cloud-instance}

To create a new Octopus Cloud instance, make sure you’re logged in to your Octopus account:

1. Go to [octopus.com/start](https://octopus.com/start).
2. Enter the URL you’d like to use to access your instance. If that URL isn’t available, try another one.
3. Select the region where you’d like to host your instance.
4. Add your company name.
5. Review the terms of our customer agreement, privacy policy, and acceptable usage policy.
6. Click **Start your trial**.

You’ll be taken to the account provisioning screen. Your Octopus Cloud instance should be ready within a minute. We’ll also email you when it’s ready to use.

## Access your Octopus Cloud instance \{#access-your-octopus-cloud-instance}

You can access your Octopus Cloud instance using the URL you chose during registration. In this example URL, `your-url` is the part of the URL you provided:

```
https://your-url.octopus.app/app#/users/sign-in
```

## Manage your Octopus Cloud subscription \{#manage-your-octopus-cloud-subscription}

You can manage your Octopus Cloud subscriptions in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).

:::div{.hint}
Our new system, Control Center V2, replaces [Control Center V1](https://octopus.com/control-center). Accounts exist in both systems, but all subscriptions are created in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
:::

### Invite users via Control Center \{#invite-users-via-control-center}

To invite a user to your Octopus Cloud instance:

1. Navigate to your Cloud instance in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
2. Click **Access Control** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Invite User**.
4. Enter the user’s details.
5. Select which role to give the user ([see role permissions below](#role-permissions)).
6. Click **Invite**.

:::figure
![Access Control page in Control Center V2](/docs/octopus-cloud/images/control-center-access-control.png)
:::

The invited user will receive an email invitation. If they already have an [Octopus ID](/docs/security/authentication/octopusid-authentication) (Octopus Deploy account), they just need to click **Accept invite** from the email and then **Sign in** to view the Octopus instance. Otherwise, they will first need to **Register** a new account using the email address the invitation was sent to.

If the invited user already has an Octopus ID, they must still accept the email invite to gain access to the subscription.

#### Role permissions \{#role-permissions}

### Manage user permissions in Octopus Cloud \{#manage-user-permissions-in-octopus-cloud}

:::div{.hint}
Users are added to an Octopus Cloud instance only after they sign in for the first time. Invited users must sign in to your Octopus Cloud instance before you can manage their permissions.
:::

Octopus uses a team-based system to manage user permissions. After their first sign-in, users are automatically assigned to one of these teams:

- **Octopus Managers**: for Cloud Subscription Owners
- **Everyone**: for Cloud Subscription Users

To assign users to different teams and adjust their permissions:

1. In your Octopus Cloud instance, go to **Configuration** (the cog icon in the bottom left sidebar).
2. Select **Teams**.
3. Create a new team or select an existing one, such as **Space Managers**.
4. Select **Add Member**.
5. Select the user from the dropdown list.
6. Click **Add**, then **Save**.

Read more about [users and teams](/docs/security/users-and-teams).

## Set the maintenance window \{#set-the-maintenance-window}

To keep Octopus Cloud running smoothly, we use outage windows to perform updates. To minimize disruptions to your deployments, please pick a two-hour [maintenance window](/docs/octopus-cloud/maintenance-window) outside of your regular business hours.

1. Navigate to your Cloud instance in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
2. Click **Configuration**.
3. Locate the Maintenance Window section and click **Change Window**.
4. Select a two-hour window.
5. Click **Submit** to save your new maintenance window.

## Change your password \{#change-password}

To change your password for the Octopus instance and Octopus account:

1. Go to [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click the drop-down menu next to your username in the top right corner.
3. Click **Profile**.
4. Click the **Change Password** link.
5. Enter your new password.
6. Confirm the new password, and click **Change password**.

## Reset your password \{#reset-password}

If you forget your username or password for your Octopus account or instance, you can reset them via octopus.com.

1. Visit [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click **Forgot your password?**
3. Reset your credentials and log into your Octopus account. You can now launch your Octopus instance from the accounts dashboard.

## Find your Octopus Cloud version \{#octopus-cloud-version}

Octopus Cloud is always up to date with the latest version of Octopus Deploy. To check which version your instance is running:

1. Log in to your Octopus Cloud instance.
2. In the bottom-left corner, look for the Octopus logo or your Gravatar (if set up).
3. Click the Octopus logo (or Gravatar) to open the menu.
4. The version appears under your name.
