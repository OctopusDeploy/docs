## Create an Octopus account \{#create-an-octopus-account}

An Octopus account lets you manage your Octopus Cloud instances. You can register an account at [octopus.com/register](https://octopus.com/register).

You can sign up with your existing Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account, or create a unique login for Octopus:

1. Enter your name.
2. Provide your email address and create a password.
3. On the next screen, verify your email address.
4. After your email has been verified, you’ll be signed into your Octopus account.

After you create an Octopus account, you can create a new Octopus Cloud instance.

## Create a Cloud instance \{#create-a-cloud-instance}

To create a new Octopus Cloud instance, make sure you’re signed in to your Octopus account:

1. Go to [octopus.com/start](https://octopus.com/start).
2. Enter the URL you’d like to use to access your instance. If that URL isn’t available, try another one.
3. Select the region where you’d like to host your instance.
4. Add your company name.
5. Review the terms of our customer agreement, privacy policy, and acceptable usage policy.
6. Click **Start your trial**.

You’ll be taken to the account provisioning screen. Your Octopus Cloud instance should be ready within a minute. We’ll also email you when it’s ready to use.

## Access your Octopus Cloud instance \{#access-your-octopus-cloud-instance}

You can access your Octopus Cloud instance using the URL you chose during registration. In this example URL, `your-url` is the part of the URL you provided:

```
https://your-url.octopus.app/app#/users/sign-in
```

## Manage user access \{#manage-user-access}

### Invite users via Control Center \{#invite-users-via-control-center}

To invite a user to your Octopus Cloud instance:

1. Navigate to your Cloud instance in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
2. Click **User Access** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Invite User**.
4. Enter the user’s details.
5. Select which role to give the user ([see role permissions below](#role-permissions)).
6. Click **Invite**.

:::

#### Email invitation \{#email-invitation}

The invited user will receive an email invitation. 

If they already have an [Octopus ID](/docs/security/authentication/octopusid-authentication) (Octopus Deploy account), they just need to click **Accept invite** in the email to gain access to the subscription and then click **Sign in** to view the Octopus instance.

Otherwise, they will first need to **Register** a new account using the email address the invitation was sent to.

#### Role permissions \{#role-permissions}

|                             | Cloud Subscription Owner                                  | Cloud Subscription User                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Control Center** <div class="table-hint">(billing.octopus.com)</div> | View Overview <br>Manage Billing</br> Manage Configuration <br>Manage User Access</br> | View Overview |
| **Octopus Instance** <div class="table-hint">(example.octopus.com)</div> | “Octopus Managers” team <div class="table-hint">By default, this team includes full permissions – a user can sign in and see and do everything.</div>| “Everyone” team  <div class="table-hint">By default, this team includes no permissions – a user can sign in but can’t see or do anything.</div> |

### Manage user permissions in Octopus Cloud \{#manage-user-permissions-in-octopus-cloud}

Invited users are only added to an Octopus Cloud instance after their first sign-in. To manage a newly invited user’s permissions, you will need to ask them to sign in to your Octopus Cloud instance first.

Octopus uses teams and user roles to manage permissions. After the invited user first signs in, they are automatically assigned to one of these teams:

- “Octopus Managers” team (Cloud Subscription Owner)
- “Everyone” team (Cloud Subscription User)

By default, the “Everyone” team includes no user roles, so users assigned to this team can sign in to your Octopus Cloud instance but won’t have permission to see or do anything.

:::div{.hint}
To give an “Everyone” team user (Cloud Subscription User) the correct permissions, you can do one or both of the following in your Octopus Cloud instance:
- Edit the “Everyone” team to include the minimum permissions all users need.
- Add the user to other teams with the correct permissions after they first sign in.
:::

To adjust a user’s permissions, you can add them to other teams:

1. In your Octopus Cloud instance, go to **Configuration** (the cog icon in the bottom left sidebar).
2. Select **Teams**.
3. Create a new team or select an existing one, such as **Space Administrators**.
4. Select **Add Member**.
5. Select the user from the dropdown list.
6. Click **Add**, then **Save**.

## Set the maintenance window \{#set-the-maintenance-window}

1. Navigate to your Cloud instance in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
