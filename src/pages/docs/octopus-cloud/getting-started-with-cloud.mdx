## Create an Octopus account \{#create-an-octopus-account}
An Octopus account lets you manage your instances of Octopus Cloud. You can register for your Octopus account at [octopus.com/register](https://octopus.com/register).

You can sign up with your existing Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account, or create a unique login for Octopus:

1. Enter your name.
2. Provide your email address and create a password.
3. On the next screen, verify your email address.
4. After your email has been verified, you’ll be logged into your Octopus account.

After you create an Octopus account, you can create a new instance of Octopus Cloud.

## Create a Cloud instance \{#create-a-cloud-instance}

To create a new instance of Octopus Cloud, make sure you’re logged in to your Octopus account:

1. Click **New Cloud Instance**.
2. Enter the URL you’d like to use to access your instance: `your-url.octopus.app`. If the URL isn’t available, enter a different URL.
3. Select the region where you’d like to host your instance.
4. Add your company name.
5. Review the terms of our customer agreement, privacy policy, and acceptable usage policy.
6. Click **Start your trial**.

You’ll be taken to the account provisioning screen. Your Octopus Cloud instance should be ready in a minute or so. You’ll receive an email when the instance is ready to use.

## Managing Octopus Cloud subscriptions \{#managing-octopus-cloud-subscriptions}

:::div{.hint}
We are in transition between two systems for managing Octopus Cloud subscriptions. We refer to the new system as Control Center V2, and it replaces the original [Control Center V1](https://octopus.com/control-center). **Accounts** are created in both systems but all new **subscriptions** are created in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).
:::

You can find all of your Octopus Cloud subscriptions in [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).

## Log in to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#log-in-to-your-octopus-cloud-instance}

You can access your Octopus Cloud instance at the URL you defined during the registration process. Where `your-url` is the part of the URL you provided:

```
https://your-url.octopus.app/app#/users/sign-in
```

## Invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance \{#inviting-octopus-cloud-users}

### Inviting users via Control Center

You can invite users to your Octopus Cloud instance from [Control Center V2](https://billing.octopus.com/).

To learn how to invite users and the levels of access you can give them, visit the [Managing Octopus subscriptions](/docs/getting-started/managing-octopus-subscriptions#user-access) page.

### Managing user permissions in Octopus Cloud

:::div{.hint}
Users are only added to an Octopus Cloud instance after they sign in for the first time. You'll need to ask your users to sign in to your Octopus Cloud instance before you can manage their team memberships and permissions.
:::

After the first sign in, users get assigned to the **“Everyone”** team (if they’re a Cloud User) or the **“Octopus Managers”** team (if they’re a Cloud Owner, or Subscription Administrator or Technical Manager). You can add users to different teams to give them appropriate permissions.

1. In your Octopus Cloud instance, go to **Configuration**.
2. Select **Teams**.
3. Create or select an existing team such as **Space Managers**.
4. Select **Add Member**.
5. Click **Add** and then **Save**.

Read more about [users and teams](/docs/security/users-and-teams).

## Set the maintenance window \{#set-the-maintenance-window}

To keep Octopus Cloud running smoothly, we must perform occasional [maintenance](/docs/octopus-cloud/maintenance-window), including updates and optimizations on your instance. 
Please pick a two-hour maintenance window in the control center. Set a time outside of your normal business hours that is unlikely to include any scheduled deployments. 

1. Log in to your Octopus account.
2. Within **Subscriptions**, select your cloud instance.
3. Click **Configuration**.
4. Scroll down to **Maintenance window**.
5. Click **Change window** and select a suitable window of at least 2 hours.
6. Click **Submit** to save your maintenance window.

## Change your password \{#change-password}

To change your password for the Octopus instance and Octopus account:
1. Go to [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click the drop-down menu next to your username in the top right corner.
3. Click **Profile**.
4. Click the **Change Password** link.
5. Enter your new password.
6. Confirm the new password, and click **Change password**.

## Reset your password \{#reset-password}

If you forget your username or password for your Octopus account or instance, you can reset them via octopus.com.

1. Visit [octopus.com/signin](https://octopus.com/signin).
2. Click **Forgot your password?**
3. Reset your credentials and log into your Octopus account. You can now launch your Octopus instance from the accounts dashboard.

## Find your Octopus Cloud version \{#octopus-cloud-version}

We keep your instance of Octopus Cloud up-to-date and running the latest version of Octopus Deploy. To check which version your instance is running: 

1. Log in to your Octopus Cloud instance.
2. In the bottom left corner, look for the Octopus logo, or your Gravatar if you have one setup. 
3. Click the Octopus logo (or your Gravatar) to open the menu. 
2. The version is shown under your name.
