navOrder: 60

Octopus is great for helping you perform repeatable and controlled deployments of your applications into [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) (GCP), but you can also use it to manage your infrastructure hosted there too. Runbooks can be used to help automate this without having to create new deployment releases.

Typical routines could be:

- Creating a Compute Engine VM instance.
- Creating a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster
- Creating IP addresses.
- Creating and managing load-balancers and target-pools.
