Octopus Deploy allows you to create and run runbooks for routine operations tasks. These tend to be procedures or routines that don't happen very frequently. 

Typical routine operations could be:

- Installing Web Application software e.g [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/introduction-to-iis/iis-web-server-overview), [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/).
- Stopping, Starting or Restarting a Website.
- Installing Application Frameworks e.g. [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), [Java](https://www.java.com/).
- Renewing SSL certificates.
