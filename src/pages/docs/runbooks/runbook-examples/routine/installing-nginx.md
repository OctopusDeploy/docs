[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is a popular web server technology used for a number of different scenarios like a standard web server, a reverse proxy, and even load balancing.  Configuration for those examples varies, but with a runbook, you can automate the installation of NGINX as a routine operational task.

## Create the runbook

To create a runbook to install NGINX on an Ubuntu machine:

1. From your project's overview page, navigate to **Operations âžœ Runbooks**, and click **ADD RUNBOOK**.
1. Give the runbook a name and click **SAVE**.
1. Click **DEFINE YOUR RUNBOOK PROCESS**, and then click **ADD STEP**.
1. Click **Script**, and then select the **Run a Script** step.
1. Give the step a name.
1. Choose the **Execution Location** on which to run this step.
1. In the **Inline source code** section, select **Bash** and add the following code:
