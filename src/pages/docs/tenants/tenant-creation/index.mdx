Now that you've created a tenant, you can enable [tenanted deployments](/docs/tenants/tenant-creation/tenanted-deployments/) and then [connect the tenant to a project](/docs/tenants/tenant-creation/connecting-projects).

:::div{.hint}
It's also possible to create a tenant using the [Octopus REST API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/). Learn more in our [create a tenant](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/tenants/create-tenant) example.

## Tenant logo \{#tenant-logo}

Try adding a logo for your tenant - this will make it much easier to distinguish your tenants. You can do this by navigating to a tenant and clicking the **Settings** tab.

Your tenants will likely be other businesses, and you could use their logo to help quickly identify the correct tenant.

You could consider using logos based on:

- Customer logos
- Data center region(s) or flags
- Individual tester(s) photo/avatar
