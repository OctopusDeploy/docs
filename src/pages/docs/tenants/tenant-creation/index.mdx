Now that you've created a tenant, you can enable [tenanted deployments](/docs/tenants/tenant-creation/tenanted-deployments/) and then [connect the tenant to a project](/docs/tenants/tenant-creation/connecting-projects).

:::div{.hint}
It's also possible to create a tenant using the [Octopus REST API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/). To learn more, see our [Create a Tenant](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/tenants/create-tenant) example.

## Tenant logo \{#tenant-logo}

Try adding a logo for your tenant - this will make it much easier to distinguish your tenants. You can do this within the Octopus Tenant section by clicking on the tenant's logo placeholder or going to the Settings tab on the tenant.

Your tenants will likely be other businesses, and you could use their logo to help quickly identify the correct tenant.

You could consider using logos based on:

- Customer logos
- Data center region(s) or flags
- Individual tester(s) photo/avatar
