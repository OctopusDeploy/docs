This section provides a number of guides that will introduce you to multi-tenant deployments in Octopus, including some of the more common scenarios we see.

:::div{.hint}
Multi-tenant deployments are an advanced pattern, and these guides assume you are already familiar with Octopus concepts like [projects](/docs/projects/), [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/), [lifecycles](/docs/releases/lifecycles/), [variables](/docs/projects/variables/) and [deploying applications](/docs/deployments).
