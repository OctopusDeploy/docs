We have included the hosting group name in the tenant name to help illustrate the pattern. In the screenshot below, you can see that the tenants have been assigned a Hosting Group tag based on which group they belong to.

This tag will make it easy to choose to deploy to all tenants in a group and also map those tenants to the correct infrastructure.

Edit a tenant and click the `Manage Tags` button to manage what tags are associated with a tenant.
