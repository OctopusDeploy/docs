From a project's Tenants page, you can see and manage the tenants that are connected to your project. You can edit the environments a tenant is connected to, disconnect a tenant, or use the [bulk tenant connection wizard](/docs/projects/tenants/bulk-connection) to connect hundreds or thousands of tenants to your project in one operation.
