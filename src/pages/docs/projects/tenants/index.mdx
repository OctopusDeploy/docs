[Tenants](/docs/tenants) in Octopus allow you to easily create customer specific deployment pipelines without duplicating project configuration.

:::

From a project's Tenants page, you can see and manage the tenants that are connected to your project. You can edit the environments a tenant is connected to, disconnect a tenant, or use the [bulk tenant connection wizard](/docs/projects/tenants/bulk-connection) to connect hundreds or thousands of tenants to your project in one operation.

## Older versions
The Project Tenants page and bulk tenant connection wizard are available from Octopus Deploy **2023.3** onwards.
