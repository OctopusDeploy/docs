Project triggers allow you to automate your deployments by responding to events, for example, changes in your deployment targets or time-based schedules.

Choose from a subset of **events** that can occur in Octopus Deploy, apply a **filter** to those events, and decide what **action** you want performed after the trigger fires.

## Trigger example

The example below is an automatic deployment trigger that fires when a [deployment target](/docs/infrastructure/) that belongs to the **Production** [environment](/docs/infrastructure/environments) becomes available and is tagged with the **web-server** [target tag](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/target-tags).

- [Deployment target triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/deployment-target-triggers): specify which events on your deployment targets will automatically trigger a release of your project.
- [Scheduled deployment triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/scheduled-deployment-trigger): define a recurring time-based schedule to automate deploying releases for your project.
- [External feed triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/external-feed-triggers): specify container images or Helm charts that will automatically trigger a release of your project.
- [Built-in package repository triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/built-in-package-repository-triggers): specify which package updates from the built-in package repository will automatically trigger a release of your project.
