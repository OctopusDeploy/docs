Project triggers allow you to define an unattended behavior for your [Projects](/docs/projects).

Project triggers allow you to choose from a subset of **events** that can occur in Octopus Deploy, apply a **filter** to those events, and decide on an **action** you want performed once the trigger fires. The example below shows an automatic deployment trigger configured to fire when a [deployment target](/docs/infrastructure/) that belongs to the **Production** [environment](/docs/infrastructure/environments) becomes available, and has the **web-server** [target tag](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/target-tags).

We have written a [comprehensive guide](/docs/deployments/patterns/elastic-and-transient-environments) about using project triggers with a focus on deploying to elastic and transient environments.
