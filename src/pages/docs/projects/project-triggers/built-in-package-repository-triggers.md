**Built-in package repository triggers were formerly known as Automatic Release Creation**

We have renamed the feature and refreshed the UI, but it still works the same way behind the scenes.
:::

## Getting started {#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-GettingStarted}

If you use the [built-in Octopus package repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories), you can now select a package, that when uploaded will automatically create a release.

:::div{.warning}
**Built-in repository only**

This trigger only supports the [built-in package repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories). There is some support for external feeds using the [external feed triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/external-feed-triggers).
:::

From the project's trigger tab, click **Add Trigger**, and then select **Built-in package repository**.

As a project can contain multiple packages you need to select the package that will upload *last* in your build and push CI process. If you have multiple packages, make sure you select the package that is always uploaded last.

When a release is set to be created this way, the audit will tell you that is how the release was created.

:::

If you combine uploading a package with the automatic deployment feature within [lifecycle phases](/docs/releases/lifecycles/#Lifecycles-LifecyclePhases), you can push a package to the internal repository, create a release, and have it automatically deploy.

:::div{.hint}
The release number that is created is guided by the Release Versioning setting under **Settings**.

## Channels {#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-Channels}

You must select the [channels](/docs/releases/channels) that will be used for any automatically created releases. This means that **only one channel for each project can have a built-in package repository trigger enabled at any one time.** This can be painful, and here are some points you can consider:

- Use one of the [build-server extensions](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/), or the [Octopus CLI](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli/create-release) to create releases instead of using triggers - this will automatically determine the best channel based on the release being created
- Choose the channel that will be used most commonly for automatically creating releases, and create releases manually for the other channels.
- Try creating some releases manually for the selected channel to make sure it works as expected.

## Automatically creating pre-releases {#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-AutomaticallyCreatingPreReleases}

When you push a package to your trigger step, Octopus will look for the latest available package for all other steps **excluding pre-release packages by default** - see [this thread](https://help.octopus.com/t/arc-not-working-with-pre-release-builds/3646) for background.

One way to work around this behavior is to create a channel with the appropriate version rules so that "latest available package" will be the pre-release packages you expected. The best way to test this is to practice creating releases manually for that channel - the "latest available package" will work the same way for manual and automatically created releases.

## Troubleshooting {#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-Troubleshooting}

When you are using built-in package repository triggers there are many reasons why a release may not be created successfully. Take some time to consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Inspect the server logs** for warnings in **Configuration âžœ Diagnostics** - Octopus will log the reason why the automatic release creation failed as errors or warnings.

2. Ensure you are pushing the package to the **built-in package repository** - use [external feed triggers](/docs/projects/project-triggers/external-feed-triggers) if you are pushing packages to other feeds.

3. Ensure you have **configured the built-in package repository trigger** for the project based on the **correct package**.

4. When using channels ensure you have **configured the built-in package repository trigger for the desired channel**.

5. Ensure you are pushing a **new version** of the package - Octopus will not create a release where the package has already been used for creating a release.

6. Ensure you are pushing a package that Octopus will consider as the **latest available package** - see the section above on [automatically creating pre-releases](#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-AutomaticallyCreatingPreReleases).

7. Ensure the release creation package step **does not** use variables for the PackageId - Octopus will only create a release where the package is constant.

8. When a release has **multiple packages**, ensure you configure the built-in package repository trigger to use the **last package that is pushed to the built-in repository** - otherwise some of the packages required for the release will be missing.

9. When using channels the package **must satisfy the version rules** for the channel being used for the built-in package repository trigger - try creating some releases manually.

10. Are you pushing **pre-release** packages? See the section above on [automatically creating pre-releases](#BuiltInPackageRepositoryTriggers-AutomaticallyCreatingPreReleases).

11. Ensure the account pushing the package has the required permissions for **each** of the **projects** and **environments** that will be involved in creating (and potentially deploying) the release. Consider which of the following permissions may be required depending on your circumstances:

    - `BuiltInFeedPush`
    - `DeploymentCreate`
    - `EnvironmentView`
    - `FeedView`
    - `LibraryVariableSetView`
    - `LifecycleView`
    - `MachineView`
    - `ProcessView`
    - `ReleaseCreate`
    - `VariableView`

**Consider using a build server extension**

We have [extensions/plugins](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/) available for the most popular build servers. These extensions will help you [create packages](/docs/packaging-applications), [push those packages to the built-in repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/built-in-repository/#pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository), create releases and deploy them to your environments:

- [AppVeyor](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/appveyor)
- [Azure DevOps & Team Foundation Server](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/tfs-azure-devops)
- [Bamboo](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/bamboo)
- [BitBucket Pipelines](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Continua CI](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/continua-ci)
- [Jenkins](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/jenkins)
- [TeamCity](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/teamcity)
