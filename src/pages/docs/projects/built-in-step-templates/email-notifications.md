Deployments can have a strong impact on the people whose work depends on the system being deployed. Great communication is an important part of a great deployment strategy, and email steps are a key way that Octopus can help you keep everyone in the loop. You may want to:

- Notify stakeholders when a new version of an app has been deployed to production.
- Let testers know when a new version is available in UAT.
- Use email in conjunction with [manual interventions approvals](/docs/projects/built-in-step-templates/manual-intervention-and-approvals) to make sure everyone is ready for a new deployment.

[Getting Started - Email Notifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VromFu8RYxc)

Before you can add email steps to your deployment processes, you need to add your SMTP configuration.

## SMTP configuration

To add your SMTP configuration navigate to **Configuration âžœ SMTP** and set the following values:

| Property           | Description                            | Example |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------   | ----------- |
| SMTP Host          | The DNS hostname for your SMTP server. | smtp.example.com |
| SMTP Port          | The TCP port for your SMTP server.     | 25 |
| Timeout            | The timeout for SMTP operations. Value is in milliseconds. | 12000 (12 seconds) |
| Use SSL/TLS        | This option controls whether or not Octopus enforces using an SSL/TLS-wrapped connection. | True |
| From Address       | The address which all emails will be sent 'From'. | octopus@mydomain.com |
| Credentials        | Optional SMTP login / password if your SMTP server requires authentication. | mylogin@mydomain.com / SuperSecretPa$$word |

Click **Save and test** to save the SMTP configuration and verify the values are valid:

:::

You will be prompted for an email address to send a test email to. Enter a test email address and click **Ok**. A *Send test email* task will start to verify your SMTP Configuration:

### Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials
Optionally you can use Workload Identity Federation and OAuth 2.0 for Google SMTP authentication. To do this, set the following values:

| Property           | Description                            | Example |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------   | ----------- |
| Audience           | The audience set on the Workload Identity Federation | `https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project-id}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool-id}/providers/{provider-id}` |
| Service Account    | The email of the service account which has been granted access | service-account-name@{project-id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com |

See the [Google cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-providers) for instructions on creating and configuring a Workload Identity Federation.

When setting up the Workload Identity Federation:
- When granting access to the service account, the principal must have the subject attribute name set to `smtp`. Example: `https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project-id}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool-id}/subject/smtp`.
- The service account must have domain wide delegation with an OAuth scope of `https://mail.google.com/`, see [documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) on how to set this up.

## Add an email step

Email steps are added to deployment processes in the same way as other steps.

1. Navigate to your [project](/docs/projects).
2. Click **Process** and **Add step** to add a step to an existing process. Alternatively, if this is a new deployment process, click the **Create process** button.
3. Find the **Send an Email** step and click **Add step**.
4. Give the step a short memorable name.
5. Choose the recipients of the email. You have several options:

   - Enter a comma-separated list of email addresses.
   - Bind to a [variable](/docs/projects/variables) which defines a list of email addresses (this is useful for tailoring your recipient list per-environment).
   - Choose [one or more teams](/docs/security/users-and-teams) to include members of those teams in the recipient list.
   - Use a combination of all of these options.
  
   Octopus will build the resulting recipient list during the deployment, remove duplicate email addresses, and send the email to each recipient.

6. Provide a subject line for the emails. The subject can contain Octopus [basic variable syntax](/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions/#basic-syntax-variablesubstitutionsyntax-basicsyntax).
7. Add the body of the email. The email can be sent in plain text or HTML, and you can use Octopus [extended variable syntax](/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions/#extended-syntax) to include information about the deployment in the email. See the [email template examples](#email-template-examples) below.
8. You can set conditions to determine when the step should run. For instance:

   - Send the email only for successful deployments to certain environments.
   - Send a specific email for failed deployments.
   - Send an email based on the value of a variable expression which works well with [output variables](/docs/projects/variables/output-variables).
9.  Save the deployment process.

## Email template examples

You can set the email subject and author the email body as plain text or HTML content. You can even use the Octopus [variable syntax](/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions) to include information about the deployment in the email.

### Deployment summary template

This template collects basic information about the deployment, including the package versions included in each step.

```xml
<h1>Deployment of #{Octopus.Project.Name} #{Octopus.Release.Number} to #{Octopus.Environment.Name}</h1>
<p>
  <em>Initiated by
    #{unless Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.Username}#{/unless}
    #{if Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{/if}
    #{if Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress} (<a href="mailto: #{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress}">#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress}</a>)#{/if}
    at #{Octopus.Deployment.Created}</em>
</p>
#{if Octopus.Release.Notes}
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>#{Octopus.Release.Notes}</p>
#{/if}
<h2>Deployment process</h2>
<p>The deployment included the following actions:</p>
<ul>
  #{each action in Octopus.Action}
    <li><strong>#{action.Name}</strong> #{if action.Package.NuGetPackageId}&mdash; <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/#{action.Package.NuGetPackageId}">#{action.Package.NuGetPackageId}</a> <em>version #{action.Package.NuGetPackageVersion}#{/if}</em></li>
  #{/each}
</ul>
<p>View the <a href="http://my-octopus#{Octopus.Web.DeploymentLink}">detailed deployment log</a>.</p>
```

:::div{.hint}
To use the template in your projects, replace `nuget.org` with the DNS name of your NuGet server, and `my-octopus` with the DNS name of your Octopus Server. Make sure you select *Body is HTML* on the email step configuration page.
:::

The output of the template will be an HTML email like:

:::figure
![](/docs/projects/built-in-step-templates/images/email-output.png)
:::

### Step status summary template

The outcome of each step can be included using a template like the one below:

```xml
<h3>Task summary</h3>
<ol>
#{each step in Octopus.Step}
  #{if step.Status.Code}
    <li>#{step | HtmlEscape} &mdash; <strong>#{step.Status.Code}</strong>
    #{if step.Status.Error}
      <pre>#{step.Status.Error | HtmlEscape}</pre>
      <pre>#{step.Status.ErrorDetail | HtmlEscape}</pre>
    #{/if}  
    </li>
  #{/if}
#{/each}
</ol>
```

:::div{.hint}
**Step error detail**

`step.Status.Error` and `step.Status.ErrorDetail` will only display the exit code and Octopus stack trace for the error. As we cannot parse the deployment log, we can only extract the exit/error codes. It cannot show detailed information on what caused the error. For full information on what happened when the deployment fails, you will need to reference the logs.

See [system variables](/docs/projects/variables/system-variables) for more detail.

### Referencing package metadata

This example displays package ID and version numbers for any steps that reference a package.

```xml
#{each action in Octopus.Action}
  #{if Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package.PackageId}
    <b>PackageId: #{Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package.PackageId}</b>
    <br>
    <b>Package Version: #{Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package.PackageVersion}</b>
  #{/if}
#{/each}
```

:::div{.hint}
Iterating over `Octopus.Action` like above is a useful way to retrieve data from all steps in your process without having to refer to a hard-coded step name that could potentially change.
:::

#### Referencing additional package metadata

Using [custom scripts](/docs/deployments/custom-scripts) you can include additional [reference packages](/docs/deployments/custom-scripts/run-a-script-step/#referencing-packages). This example displays package ID and version numbers for any steps that include additional reference packages.

```xml
#{each action in Octopus.Action}
  #{each package in action.Package}
    #{if Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package[#{package}].PackageId}
      <b>PackageId: #{Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package[#{package}].PackageId}</b>
      <br>
      <b>Package Version: #{Octopus.Action[#{action.StepName}].Package[#{package}].PackageVersion}</b>
    #{/if}
  #{/each}
#{/each}
```
