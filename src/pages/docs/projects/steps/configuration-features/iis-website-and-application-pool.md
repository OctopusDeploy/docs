The IIS Web Site and Application Pool feature is one of the [configuration features](/docs/projects/steps/configuration-features/index.md) you can enable as you define the [steps](/docs/projects/steps/index/) in your [deployment process](/docs/projects/deployment-process/).

The **IIS Web Site and Application Pool** feature is available on **deploy a package** steps, however, there is also a **Deploy to IIS** step which offers the same features and is designed specifically for IIS deployments.

See [IIS Websites and Applications](/docs/deployments/windows/iis-websites-and-application-pools/) for more details.
