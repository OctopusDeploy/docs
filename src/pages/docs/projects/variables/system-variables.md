This page lists built-in [variables](/docs/projects/variables/) provided by Octopus that can be used in your deployment [custom scripts](/docs/deployments/custom-scripts).

Most of the variables listed here are available in modern versions of Octopus and Calamari. However, some are only available from a specific version. Where this is the case, the version will be noted alongside the variable.

:::div{.warning}
**All variables are strings**
Note that when evaluating values, **all Octopus variables are strings** even if they look like numbers or other data types.

#### Octopus.Release.Package details

The `Octopus.Release.Package` variable is a collection of `Package` objects based on the following structures:

```csharp
public class Package
{
  public string PackageId { get; set; }
  public string Version { get; set; }
  public WorkItemLink[] WorkItems { get; set; }
  public Commit[] Commits { get; set; }
}

public class WorkItemLink
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string LinkUrl { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}

public class Commit
{
    public string CommitId { get; set; }
    public string LinkUrl { get; set; }
    public string Comment { get; set; }
}
```

The packages in a release are available as a collection which can be [iterated over](/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions/#VariableSubstitutionSyntax-Repetition).  e.g.

```
#{each package in Octopus.Release.Package}
    This release contains #{package.PackageId} #{package.Version}
#{/each}
```

A particular package can be selected by indexing on the package ID:

```
#{Octopus.Release.Package[Acme.Web].Version}
```

The variables available for packages are:

| Name | Example|
| -------------------- | -------|
|`PackageId`| `#{package.PackageId}` |
|`Version`| `#{package.Version}` |
|`Commits`| This is a collection.  See below. |
|`WorkItems`| This is a collection.  See below. |

On each package, the commits associated with that package are available as a collection which can be iterated over. e.g.:

```
#{each package in Octopus.Release.Package}
#{each commit in package.Commits}
- [#{commit.CommitId}](#{commit.LinkUrl}) - #{commit.Comment}
#{/each}
#{/each}
```

A particular commit can be selected by indexing on the commit ID (when using git the commit ID is the commit hash):

```
package.Commits[685afd4161d085e6e5f56a66e72e2298e402b114].Comment
```

The variables available for commits are:

| Name | Example|
| -------------------- | -------|
|`CommitId`| `#{commit.CommitId}` |
|`LinkUrl`| `#{commit.LinkUrl}` |
|`Comment`| `#{commit.Comment}` |

If the Octopus instance has one or more of the [Issue Tracker integrations](/docs/releases/issue-tracking) enabled, the commit messages will be parsed for issues. Any issues found will be displayed with the build information, and also available as variables:

```
#{each issue in package.WorkItems}
- [#{issue.Id}](#{issue.LinkUrl})
#{/each}
```

A particular issue can be selected by indexing on the ID:

```
package.WorkItems[4465].LinkUrl
```

The variables available for issues are:

| Name | Example|
| -------------------- | -------|
|`Id`| `#{issue.Id}` |
|`LinkUrl`| `#{issue.LinkUrl}` |

There is also a distinct list of issues across all packages available in:

```
#{each workItem in Octopus.Release.WorkItems}
- [#{workItem.Id}](#{workItem.LinkUrl}) - #{workItem.Description}
#{/each}
```

#### Octopus.Release.Builds details

The `Octopus.Release.Builds` variable is a collection of Build objects based on the following structures:

```csharp
public class Build

  public string BuildEnvironment { get; set; }
  public string BuildNumber { get; set; }
  public string VcsRoot { get; set; }
  public string VcsType { get; set; }
  public string VcsCommitNumber { get; set; }
  public string VcsCommitUrl { get; set; }
}

public class BuildPackage
{
  public string PackageId { get; set; }
  public string Version { get; set; }
}
```

The builds in a release are available as a collection which can be [iterated over](/docs/projects/variables/variable-substitutions/#VariableSubstitutionSyntax-Repetition).  e.g.

```
#{each build in Octopus.Release.Builds}
    This release contains resources contributed by the build #{build.BuildUrl}
#{/each}

## Worker Pool {#Systemvariables-WorkerPool}

When a step is run on a worker, the following variables are available:

`Octopus.WorkerPool.Id`

The Id of the pool.

Example: WorkerPools-1

`Octopus.WorkerPool.Name`

The name of the pool.

Example: Default Worker Pool

## Server {#Systemvariables-Server}

Server-level variables describe the Octopus Server on which the deployment is running.

`Octopus.Web.BaseUrl`

The default URL at which the server API can be accessed. Note that this is based off the server's ListenPrefixes and works in simple configuration scenarios. If you have a load balancer or reverse proxy this value will likely not be suitable for use in referring to the server from a client perspective, e.g. in email templates etc.

Example: *[https://my-octopus](https://my-octopus)*

`Octopus.Web.ServerUri`

The default URL at which the server portal can be accessed, as configured in the **Configuration ➜ Nodes** settings. This variable was added in Octopus **2019.4.0**.

*[https://my-octopus](https://my-octopus)*

## Tracking deployment status {#Systemvariables-DeploymentStatusTrackingdeploymentstatus}

During deployment, Octopus provides variables describing the status of each step.

Where `S` is the step name, Octopus will set:

```powershell
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Code
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Error
Octopus.Step[S].Status.ErrorDetail
```

Status codes include `Pending`, `Skipped`, `Abandoned`, `canceled`, `Running`, `Succeeded` and `Failed`.

For an action `A:`

```powershell
Octopus.Action[A].IsSkipped
```

For the deployment as a whole:

```powershell
Octopus.Deployment.Error
Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail
```

:::div{.hint}
**Error detail returned**
Octopus.Deployment.Error and Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail will only display the exit code and Octopus stack trace for the error. As we cannot parse the deployment log, we can only extract the exit/error codes. It cannot show detailed information on what caused the error. For full information on what happened when the deployment fails, you will need to reference the logs.

## User-modifiable settings {#Systemvariables-User-modifiablesettings}

The following variables can be defined as variables in your project to modify the way Octopus behaves.

`Octopus.Acquire.MaxParallelism`

Maximum number of NuGet packages that should be downloaded at once when acquiring packages.

Example: 3

`Octopus.Action.MaxParallelism`

The maximum number of deployment targets on which the action will concurrently execute, and the maximum number of steps which will run in parallel. This value can be set in a project variable to change the default for the project. Additionally you can scope a value to specific actions to control concurrency across your deployment targets. This is the same variable which is set when configuring a [rolling deployment](/docs/deployments/patterns/rolling-deployments). *(Number - Default: 10)*.

Example: *5*

`OctopusPrintVariables`

Set to "True" to tell Tentacle to print the value of all variables passed to it. We recommend only using this setting for non-production environments.

Example: True

`OctopusPrintEvaluatedVariables`

Set to "True" to tell Tentacle to print the value of all variables passed to it after evaluating them. We recommend only using this setting for non-production environments.

Example: True

`OctopusSkipFreeDiskSpaceCheck`

Set to "True" to skip the check for available free disk space when deploying packages. **Introduced in Calamari version 3.1.30.**.

Example: True

`OctopusFreeDiskSpaceOverrideInMegaBytes`

The amount (in megabytes) of available free disk space we should check for (overriding the default 500MB), failing the deployment if not enough free disk space is available. **Introduced in Calamari version 3.1.30**.

Example: 100

`Octopus.Action.PowerShell.CustomPowerShellVersion`

If specified, Windows PowerShell scripts will be invoked using `PowerShell.exe -version {Version}` where {Version} is the value you specified. Accepted values are *2.0*, *3.0*, *4.0, 5.0*.<br/>PowerShell Core scripts will be invoked using the installed version of PowerShell core which matches the specified value. The value must match one of the directories contained within `%PROGRAMFILES%\PowerShell`. Example values include *6* and *7-preview*.<br/>**Introduced in Calamari version 3.3.13.**.

Example: 2.0

`OctopusDeleteScriptsOnCleanup`

For packaged scripts, set to "False" to keep the PreDeploy/Deploy/PostDeploy scripts in the target directory (i.e. don't cleanup).

Example: False

`Octopus.Action.Script.SuppressEnvironmentLogging`

To suppress/disable the environment logging that occurs from script (eg. PowerShell or Bash Script Environment Variables logging). This only suppresses script logging and does not suppress the Octopus or Calamari environment logging. **Introduced in Calamari version 3.6.5.**.

Example: True

`Octopus.Action.PowerShell.ExecuteWithoutProfile`

Set to `true` to not run the Tentacle service account's PowerShell profile script when running PowerShell script steps (available in version 3.3.21+).

Example: True

`OctopusSuppressDuplicateVariableWarning`

Set to `true` to have the duplicate variable message logged as verbose instead of warning. **Do this if you are aware of the duplication and that it isn't causing any issues in your deployment**  (available in version 3.17.0+).

Example: True

`Octopus.Action.Package.RunScripts`

Set to `false` to prevent scripts inside packages from executing. **Do this if you are aware of the duplication and that it isn't causing any issues in your deployment**  (available in version 4.1.10+).

Example: True

`Octopus.Calamari.CopyWorkingDirectoryIncludingKeyTo`

Set to a file-path and the Calamari working directory will be copied to the configured location. **Copied files include the one-time key to decrypt sensitive variables** [More details.](/docs/support/copy-working-directory).

Example: `c:\temp\octopus-debug`

`Octopus.Deployment.WorkerLeaseCap`

This is an opt-in variable to help distribute multiple steps referencing the same package (including container) across a worker pool. By setting this, a worker will be reused for steps up to the cap, after which another worker will be selected and reused in the same way. If all workers have reached the cap, additional steps will be spread out evenly. By default this behaviour is disabled, and the same worker will be reused for all steps referencing the same package. Opt in by setting the variable to a number higher than 0.

Example: `1` - achieves a similar effect to round robin.  
Example: `5` - a balance between reducing package transfer and distributing load.

Note: This value applies to both deployment processes and runbooks, as long as it's scoped to the particular scenario.

`Octopus.Task.ConcurrencyTag`

Octopus will run one task at a time for a given concurrency tag. Set the variable to run tasks in parallel instead of serial or in serial instead of parallel. For example, tenanted deployments run in parallel by default. Removing tenants from the concurrency tag will run them serially: #{Octopus.Project.Id}/#{Octopus.Environment.Id}

Example: #{Octopus.Deployment.Tenant.Id}/#{Octopus.Project.Id}/#{Octopus.Environment.Id}
