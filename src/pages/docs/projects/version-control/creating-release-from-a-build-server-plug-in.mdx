<BuildServerPluginVersionControlFields />

Below are some examples of how to auto populate these fields using build parameters for common build servers.

## Azure DevOps
 
Azure DevOps stores information differently based on if the build is triggered by a branch push versus via a Pull Request (PR). You need to use a conditional statement to select the right variable. Here's a suggested method to do so.

For *Git Reference*, use
```
$[coalesce(variables['system.pullRequest.sourceBranch'], variables['build.sourceBranch'])]
```

For *Git Commit*, use
```
$[coalesce(variables['system.pullRequest.sourceCommitId'], variables['build.sourceVersion'])]
```

**Note:** this approach doesn't populate the commit details for manually triggered runs. It is recommended that you provide the values for both branch and commit in this case.


## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides different event data based on if the build is triggered by a branch push versus via a Pull Request (PR). You need to use a conditional statement to select the right variable. Here's a suggested method to do so.

For *Git Reference*, use
```
${{ github.head_ref || github.ref }}
```

For *Git Commit*, use
```
${{ github.event.push.after || github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
```

**Note:** this approach doesn't populate the commit details for manually triggered runs. It is recommended that you provide the values for both branch and commit in this case.


## TeamCity

TeamCity provides different data based on if the build is triggered by a branch push versus via a Pull Request (PR). There is no easy way to automate selecting the right one. Based on your process, we suggest using one of the following options. 

### Git Reference

If the build is triggered by a branch push, use 
```
%teamcity.build.branch%
```
If the build is triggered via a PR, use 
```
%teamcity.pullRequest.source.branch%
```


### Git Commit

This is the same for both scenarios.
```
%build.vcs.number%
```

### Notes
If multiple VCS sources are used in a build, remember to add the fully qualified parameter that includes the VCS Root ID. For example, `teamcity.build.branch.<VCS_Root_ID>` and  `build.vcs.number.<VCS_Root_ID>`.

For a build resulting from a chained step, you may need to reference a parameter from the original build dependency. It will look something like this for a *Git Commit* - `dep.<Dependant_Build_ID>.build.vcs.number` or `dep.<Dependant_Build_ID>.build.vcs.number.<VCS_Root_Id>`.
