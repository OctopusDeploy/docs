The Octopus Server is the deployment automation server where you define your deployment processes and runbooks and manage the releases of your software.

The Octopus Server includes the Octopus Rest API and the Octopus Web Portal.

You can use the Octopus REST API or the Octopus Web Portal to design your deployment processes and your releases, connect to the servers, services, and accounts where your software will be deployed, and to use runbooks to automate routine maintenance and emergency operations tasks like infrastructure provisioning, database management, and website failover and restoration.
