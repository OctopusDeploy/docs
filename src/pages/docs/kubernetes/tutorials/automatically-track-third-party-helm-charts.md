title: Automatically tracking third party helm charts
description: External feed triggers allow you to automatically create a new release as a result of new container images or helm charts being pushed to their respective repositories.

With a growing number of applications being provided with Helm charts as a primary method of installation, often all that needs to be done is a `helm install` against your cluster and the application will be up and running.

However managing updates can be a more involved process. Not only do you need to know when a new release is available, but you also need to have someone with credentials to run the `helm upgrade` against your cluster. Meaning you'll either need to share important credentials among everyone performing updates or have only a few people busy performing these updates.

Octopus Deploy provides a full workflow to manage updates, either hands on or fully hands off.

### Setting up the project

A Helm chart deployment like this is simple with Octopus Deploy.

1. Start with the **Deploy a Helm chart** step
2. Link it to the required Kubernetes clusters via [target tags](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/target-tags)
3. Reference the desired Helm chart
4. Configure the namespace and any values required for your application

:::

Sample OCL for version controlled projects:

```ruby
step "deploy-ingress-nginx-helm-chart" {
    name = "Deploy Ingress Nginx Helm Chart"
    properties = {
        Octopus.Action.TargetRoles = "kind"
    }

    action {
        action_type = "Octopus.HelmChartUpgrade"
        properties = {
            Octopus.Action.Helm.ClientVersion = "V3"
            Octopus.Action.Helm.Namespace = "nginx-local"
            Octopus.Action.Helm.ReleaseName = "ingress-nginx"
            Octopus.Action.Helm.ResetValues = "True"
            Octopus.Action.Package.DownloadOnTentacle = "False"
            Octopus.Action.Package.FeedId = "ingress-nginx"
            Octopus.Action.Package.PackageId = "ingress-nginx"
        }

        packages {
            acquisition_location = "Server"
            feed = "ingress-nginx"
            package_id = "ingress-nginx"
            properties = {
                SelectionMode = "immediate"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Helpful settings

By default, Octopus will start versioning releases from `0.0.1` and count up patch versions from there. Helm charts already have a meaningful version number that you may wish to use instead.

You can change our releases to track the Helm chart version by heading to the project settings and changing the release versioning rule to use the version number from our deployment step.

:::figure
![Change release versioning](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-versioning-rule.png)
:::

Sample OCL for version controlled projects:

```ruby
versioning_strategy {
    donor_package {
        step = "deploy-ingress-nginx-helm-chart"
    }
}
```

### Creating the trigger

Triggers can be created directly from the deployment process by clicking the **Create a trigger** link, or by navigating to the **Triggers** page and clicking **Add Trigger**.

Enter a name and a select which container images or Helm charts you'd like to watch for updates.
In this example, the Default channel has a lifecycle that will automatically deploy to the Development environment for testing, more on that later.

:::figure
![Helm chart create trigger](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-create-trigger.png)
:::

Once the trigger is created, you can watch the triggers execution history. Within a couple of minutes you'll see your very first release created.

### Automatic deployment strategies

Back on the project dashboard, you can see the release isn't only created but successfully deployed to your cluster as well.

:::figure
![Helm chart deployed release](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-deployed-release.png)
:::

But what if there was only a production environment? You may be a bit more careful with deploying updates the moment they are released. You can control this with channels and lifecycles.

First [create a new lifecycle](/docs/releases/lifecycles), called Production here.

:::figure
![Helm chart production lifecycle](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-production-lifecycle.png)
:::

Then [create a channel](/docs/releases/channels) in the project that uses this lifecycle.

:::figure
![Helm chart production channel](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-production-channel.png)
:::

Back in the trigger, change the channel to Production instead.

:::figure
![Helm chart trigger production channel](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-trigger-production-channel.png)
:::

New releases will remain undeployed until someone has time to manually review the changes and click **Deploy**.

:::figure
![Helm chart undeployed release](/docs/deployments/kubernetes/automatically-track-third-party-helm-charts/helm-chart-undeployed-release.png)
:::

These are two simple cases, take a look at [environment recommendations](/docs/infrastructure/environments/environment-recommendations) for more information on what's possible.

#### Getting notified about new releases

Now you have a list of releases created and waiting to be deployed. This isn't very useful if no one knows about it.

Octopus deploy offers a quick and easy notification service through [subscriptions](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/subscriptions) that allow you to send the right people an email or message whenever a release is created in a particular project.
