You can use the REST API to create and manage your Octopus [releases](/docs/releases). Typical tasks can include:

- [Create a release with specific version](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/releases/create-release-with-specific-version)
- [Delete project releases](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/releases/delete-project-releases)
- [Promote a release not in the destination](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/releases/promote-release-not-in-destination)
- [Update release variable snapshot](/docs/octopus-rest-api/examples/releases/update-release-variable-snapshot)
