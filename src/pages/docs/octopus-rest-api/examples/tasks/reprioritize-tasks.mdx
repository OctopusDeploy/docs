title: Reprioritize Tasks
description: An example script to find deployments or runbook runs for a specific environment, project, or tenant and move them to the top of the queue.
---
import ReprioritizeTasks from 'src/shared-content/scripts/reprioritize-tasks.include.md';

This script can be used to move critical deployments from the bottom of the queue to the top of the queue.  

How it works:

1. Look at all the pending tasks in the queue.  All in-process items are left as is.
2. If there are any deployments or runbook runs, it will check to see if they match specified criteria.
3. If any matching runbook runs or deployment tasks are found, it will loop through the queue and cancel all the items before them.
4. If the script cancels any runbook runs or deployments, it will resubmit them using the same values.

For example, you have this in your pending queue:

1. Deployment to Dev
2. Runbook run on Maintenance
3. Retention policy run
4. Deployment to Production

It will cancel the deployment to `Dev`, the runbook run on `Maintenance`, and the retention policy run.  It will then resubmit the deployment to `Dev,` and the runbook run on `Maintenance` using the same parameters. The user who appears in the audit log will be the one attached to the API key.

## Usage

Provide values for:

- Octopus URL (required)
- Octopus API Key (required)

The script looks for tasks one of two ways:

1. Task Id List - comma separated list of task ids to move to the top of the queue
2. Matching based on criteria, see below

Matching based on criteria
- Space List - comma separated list of spaces to look for (optional)
- Environment List - comma separated list of environments to look for (optional)
    - Options: 
        - `EnvironmentName` - eg `Production` - looks for the `Production` environment in any space from the space list.
        - `EnvironmentName::SpaceName` - eg `Production::Default` - looks for the `Production` environment in the `Default` space only.
- Project List - comma separated list of projects to look for (optional)
    - Options: 
        - `ProjectName` - eg `Hello World` - looks for the `Hello World` project in any space from the space list.
        - `ProjectName::SpaceName` - eg `Hello World::Default` - looks for the `Hello World` project in the `Default` space only.
- Tenant List - comma separated list of tenants to look for (optional)
    - Options: 
        - `TenantName` - eg `My Tenant` - looks for the `My Tenant` tenant in any space from the space list.
        - `TenantName::SpaceName` - eg `My Tenant::Default` - looks for the `My Tenant` tenant in the `Default` space only.
- Match Type - how the match will happen
    - Options:
        - `Or` - will look for runbook run or deployment that matches any of the filters - eg `Production` OR `Hello World` OR `My Tenant`
        - `And` - will look for runbook run or deployment that matches all of the filters - eg `Production` AND `Hello World` AND `My Tenant`
    - If a filter isn't supplied it is excluded from the check
- Task Type - what task type to look for
    - Options:
        - `Deploy` - looks for deployments only
        - `RunbookRun` - looks for runbook runs only
        - `Both` - looks for both deployments and runbooks runs

You must supply at least one task id OR at least one filter for environments OR projects OR tenants must be supplied.
