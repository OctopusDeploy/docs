title: Project permissions report
description: An example script that will provide a report of which users have access to specific projects.
---
import ProjectPermissionsReport from 'src/shared-content/scripts/project-permissions-report.include.md';

The Octopus Web Portal provides the ability to see the permissions from a user's point of view.  This script demonstrates how to generate a report of permissions from a project's point of view.

**Please note:** The report is generated as a CSV file, formatting was added to the screenshot to make it easier to read.

A user could be assigned to multiple teams with multiple role scopings.  This script will determine the "most permissive" role scoping and display that.  For example:

- User A is assigned to Team B that has permissions to deploy to **Production**.
- User A is assigned to Team C that has permissions to deploy to any environment.

The report should show the user has permissions to deploy to any environment.  

The report will also combine environment and tenant scoping.  For example:

- User A is assigned to Team B that has permissions to deploy to **Production**.
- User A is assigned to Team C that has permissions to deploy to **Staging**.

The report should show the user has permissions to deploy to **Staging;Production**.  

Finally, if a user is scoped to an environment or tenant that is _not_ associated with the project then that scoping is excluded from the report.  

## Usage

Provide values for the following:

- Octopus URL
- Octopus API Key
- Report Path
- Space Filter
- Project Filter
- User Filter

The filters allow you to choose which space(s), project(s), and user(s) to generate a report for.  They all have the same features.

- `all` will return the results for all spaces/projects/users.
- Wildcard or `*` will return all spaces/projects/users matching the wildcard search.
- Specific name will only show the exact matching spaces/projects/users.

The filters support comma-separated entries.  Setting the User Filter to `Test,Bob*` will find all users with the display name of `Test` or that start with `Bob`.
