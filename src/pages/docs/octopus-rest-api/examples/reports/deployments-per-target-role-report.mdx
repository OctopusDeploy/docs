title: Deployments Per Deployment Target Role Report
description: An example script that will provide a list of all the deployment targets in a given role and their respective deployments.
---
import DeploymentsPerTargetRoleReport from 'src/shared-content/scripts/deployments-per-target-role-report.include.md';

The Octopus Web Portal allows you to see what deployments have gone out to a specific deployment target, but it doesn't provide you with a list of deployments for all the deployment targets in a role.  This script demonstrates how to generate such a report.
