title: Project Release Deployment Targets Report
description: An example script that will provide a list of all the deployments and deployment targets deployed to.
---
import ProjectDeploymentTargetsReport from 'src/shared-content/scripts/project-deployment-targets-report.include.md';

The Octopus Web Portal allows you to see what deployments have gone out to a specific deployment target, but it doesn't provide you with a list of deployment targets for each deployment.  This script demonstrates how to generate a report of the deployment targets for a specific release version for a project.
