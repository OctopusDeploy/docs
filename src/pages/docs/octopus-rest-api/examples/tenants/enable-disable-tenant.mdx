title: Enable/disable tenants
description: An example script that enables or disables a tenant in Octopus.
---
import EnableDisableTenantScripts from 'src/shared-content/scripts/enable-disable-tenant-scripts.include.md';

In 2025.1 Octopus has added support for disabling tenants. Disabled tenants do not allow deployments or runbook runs but are able to be edited. They are also removed from license calculations allowing you to effectively archive unused tenants and re-enable them in the future.
Disabled tenants are highlighted with grayed out text and are not available for selection on the deployment or runbook run pages. If deployments are created for disabled tenants via the API or CLI an exception will be thrown.

This script demonstrates how to programmatically enable or disable a tenant.

## Usage

Provide values for the following:

- Octopus URL
- Octopus API Key
- Name of the space to use
- Name of the tenant
- Boolean value for enabled

## Script

<EnableDisableTenantScripts />
