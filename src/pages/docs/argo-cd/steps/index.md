Octopus offers two in-built steps which are able to modify a mapped Argo CD application in different ways:

1. Update Application Image Tags
2. Update Application Manifest

## Update Application Image Tags
This step is responsible for identifying images referenced by an application, and updating their image-tags to the
value defined in the Octopus Deployment.

For 'Basic Yaml' and 'Kustomize' based Argo CD Applications, the behaviour for performing the update relies on the known
structure of the kubernetes/kustomize yaml to ensure the correct fields are updated.

However, for Helm-based Argo CD Applications, where image-tags are specified within the `values.yaml` file, additional
information is required to explicitly define _which_ fields in the values represent an image reference.

### Helm Annotations

These annotations are required if your application's repository contains a Helm chart, regardless of the

## Update Application Manifests
This step is responsible for populating an Argo CD Application's git repository with content generated by populating user-provided 
templates with [Octopus Variables](/docs/projects/variables/getting-started).
