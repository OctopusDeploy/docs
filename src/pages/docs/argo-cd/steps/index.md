Octopus offers two in-built steps which are able to modify a mapped Argo CD application in different ways:

1. Update Argo CD Application Image Tags
2. Update Argo CD Application Manifests

## Steps

### Update Argo CD Application Image Tags

This step is responsible for identifying images referenced by an application, and updating their image-tags to the
value defined in the Octopus Deployment.

For 'Basic Yaml' and 'Kustomize' based Argo CD Applications, the behavior for performing the update relies on the known
structure of the kubernetes/kustomize yaml to ensure the correct fields are updated.

However, for Helm-based Argo CD Applications, where image-tags are specified within the `values.yaml` file, additional
information is required to explicitly define *which* fields in the values represent an image reference.

See [Helm annotations](/docs/argo-cd/annotations/helm-annotations) for more information and examples.

You can read more about this step [here](/docs/argo-cd/steps/update-application-image-tags).

### Update Argo CD Application Manifests

This step is responsible for populating an Argo CD Application's Git repository with content generated by populating user-provided 
templates with [Octopus Variables](/docs/projects/variables/getting-started).

You can read more about this step [here](/docs/argo-cd/steps/update-application-manifests).

## Output Variables

When these steps are executed, they each create a number of [output variables](/docs/projects/variables/output-variables) which contain information relating to the
step's execution, these variables include:

| Variable name      | Content                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PullRequest.Title  | The title of the PR created in the step, empty if no PR was created.                    |
| PullRequest.Number | The unique identifier of the PR within your git repository, empty if no PR was created. |
| PullRequest.Url    | The Url of the PR created, empty if no PR was created.                                  |

These variables will be available for subsequent steps in your deployment process.
