Octopus makes it easy to improve your Argo CD deployments with  environment modeling and deployment orchestration built-in. Automate everything 
from environment promotion and compliance to tests and change management.

Octopus makes integrating and deploying with Argo CD simple:
1. Creating a connection to Argo CD instances and cross mapping Argo CD Applications to Octopus Projects
2. Deployment steps which can update the Git repositories backing the mapped Argo CD Applications
3. Dashboards and live status displays, showing the result of deployment, and the status of the deployed applications and resources

The pages in this section expands each of these areas, while also providing useful resources and tutorials to get you
up and running with Argo CD in Octopus faster.
