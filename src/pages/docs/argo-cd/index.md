Octopus makes Argo CD easier to use with environment modeling and deployment orchestration built-in. Automate everything 
from environment promotion and compliance to tests and change management.

Octopus Deploy integrates with Argo CD at three key touchpoints:
1. Creating a connection to Argo CD instances and cross mapping Argo Applications to Octopus Projects
2. Deployment steps which can update the git repositories backing the mapped Argo Applications
3. Dashboards and live status displays, showing how deployments outcomes, and currently deployed resources

The pages in this section expands each of these areas, while also providing useful resources and tutorials to get you
up and running with Argo CD faster.
