## Set built-in feed retention policy \{#built-in-feed}

You can find the built-in repository retention policy settings under **Deploy ➜ Packages**.

In Octopus Server, this can be set to keep packages forever, or for a set number of days.

Choosing _A limited time_ will allow you to select the number of days to keep a package in the repository. The default value is 30, but you can choose something shorter or longer based on your needs.

### Which packages are deleted

:::div{.hint}
**Note on package clean-up**

Only packages that are not associated with releases will be cleaned up. That means even if a package is older than the value you choose, if it's attached to an existing release, it won't be cleaned up until that release is also cleaned up.
:::

When a package retention policy is applied, Octopus will delete packages that meet _both_ of the following criteria:

1. The time span from the package's initial publish date exceeds the configured time period in the policy
2. The package is **not associated with any releases in Octopus**.

## Set up deleting packages associated with releases

:::div{.info}
From Octopus version 2025.3.672, packages associated with releases in the Octopus Built-in repository can be deleted. This feature is being rolled out gradually behind a feature toggle. If you would like to request this functionality early, please contact [support](https://octopus.com/support).

To enable deleting packages associated with releases, from the Built-in Repository Retention configuration page:

- Select **A limited time** and configure the number of days to retain packages.
- Select **Delete all packages after the number of days specified above**

This option ensures that packages associated with releases and runbook runs are deleted from the Built-in Repository. Any packages associated with releases displayed on either the main dashboard or a [project dashboard](/docs/projects/project-dashboard) are **never deleted**. Any packages associated with runbooks displayed on the projects runbook dashboard are also **never deleted**.

When this option is selected and a package retention policy is applied, Octopus will delete packages that meet _both_ of the following criteria:

1. The time span from the package's initial publish date exceeds the configured time period in the policy
2. The package is **not associated with a release or runbook run displayed on the dashboard**
