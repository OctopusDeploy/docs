## How retention policies work with lifecycle phases \{#retention-policies-and-lifecycle-phases}

You can set individual retention policies to phases. This gives you much more control over environments, such as never deleting from production but having a strict rigorous deletion from your development environment.

But how does it work? For a release we determine what phase it is currently in. So if a release is created and no deployments have been done, the default lifecycle retention policy is the active setting for that release. When it is then deployed to the first phase, that retention policy becomes the active setting for the release, and so on. So when the release hits the production phase, and is set to keep all, that release will be kept, as will any deployments done to any environment of that release.

If you have a release retention policy for a project that has a final phase of keep all releases, once the release enters that phase it will never be deleted. But if you have a release that has not yet deployed to any environments in the final phase, and is set to only keep the last 3 releases, then the release will be deleted when it becomes the 4th release of the project that has not yet been deployed to any final phase environment (unless it is still on the dashboard).

### Example lifecycle retention policy task

In this section we walk through what's deleted for an example project when the retention policy task runs. Consider a project that has the following lifecycle defined:

:::figure
![Release retention task example lifecycle](/docs/img/administration/retention-policies/images/retention-lifecycle-example.png)
:::

It contains two phases, both are set to keep the last 3 releases.

The project has 15 releases, of which:

- `0.0.10` through `0.0.15` have not been deployed to any environment.
- `0.0.7` through `0.0.9` are deployed to Staging.
- `0.0.1` through `0.0.6` are deployed to both Staging and Production.

When the retention policy runs for this lifecycle, it keeps a count of both **undeployed releases** it finds, as well as a separate count for **releases per phase**.

For a release to be deleted, the count must be greater than the required number for each phase the release has been deployed to. In this example, release `0.0.2` is the fourth release kept for Staging, but only the third for Production, so it will be kept.

Each phase defined in this lifecycle will keep a maximum of **5 releases**:

- 1 release for the current dashboard version.
- 1 release for the dashboard version's rollback.
- The last 3 releases, as configured in the phase.

Undeployed releases will simply keep the number we have selected and no more. When the retention policy task runs, 4 releases are deleted:

## Set release retention policies \{#set-release-retention-policies}

Under **Manage ➜ Lifecycles** you select the Lifecycle you want to define or edit your retention policy for:

:::figure
![](/docs/img/administration/retention-policies/images/lifecycles.png)
:::

Each phase will inherit the retention policy from the above phase, but this is something you can change by expanding the Retention Policy panel.

:::figure
![](/docs/img/administration/retention-policies/images/lifecycle-retention-policy.png)
:::

_Releases_ determines what is kept on the Octopus Server, and _Files on Tentacle_ determines what files are kept on the Tentacle.

In Octopus Server, you can keep all, or select a number of releases to keep.

Alternatively, you can specify a number of days worth of releases and files to keep.

### Updating the default retention policy

:::div{.info}
From Octopus Cloud version 2025.4, the default lifecycle retention policy for a space can be customized. This feature is behind a feature toggle, please contact michelle.obrien@octopus.com if you would like to turn this feature on.
:::

:::figure
![](/docs/img/administration/retention-policies/images/centralized-retention-lifecycle.png)
:::

You can update the default retention settings used by lifecycle under **Manage ➜ Retention ➜ Release Retention**.

:::div{.info}
Updating this retention policy will update all Lifecycles in the space that is using the "_Default retention policy_".

### Inherited retention policies

As mentioned above, any phase that does not have a retention policy set will inherit its retention policy in the following priority:

1. From the latest previous phase with a custom retention policy
2. From the lifecycle retention policy

This can be observed in the following retention policy setup:

- Lifecycle: Keep 3 Releases
- Phase 1 (Dev): Inherit (Keep 3 Releases)
- Phase 2 (Test): Inherit (Keep 3 Releases)
- Phase 3 (Staging): Keep 5 Releases
- Phase 4 (Prod): Inherit (Keep 5 Releases)

Note how Dev and Test inherit their policies from the lifecycle retention policy as there is no previous phase with a custom retention policy. As Prod comes after Staging, a phase which has a custom retention policy, Prod inherits its retention policy from Staging instead.

Phases prioritize retention policies from the latest previous phase over the lifecycle retention policy as later phases tend to be treated more seriously. The more serious a phase is, the more the retention policy matters. The final phases are more likely to be production environments, and therefore once a release reaches this point you will want to keep more of them.
