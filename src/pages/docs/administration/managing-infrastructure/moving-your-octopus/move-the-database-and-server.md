title: Moving the Octopus Server and database
description: Walk-through outlining how to move an Octopus database from one server to another.
navOrder: 300
---

You may need to move your Octopus Server and database installation. The following process is the recommended approach. Skipping any step in this process can result in encryption errors or missing data and files.

## Before you move your Octopus instance
- You will need your Master Key to connect your existing database to your new Octopus installation. You can retrieve and save a copy of the [Master Key](/docs/security/data-encryption) in the Octopus Manager.
- Data that is stored in the file system needs to be moved over to the new server. This includes packages stored in the built-in repository, artifacts (including project logos), task logs, and event exports.
- Tentacle thumbprints are stored in the database. You won't need to re-configure your Tentacles if you're using the same database.

**You can only move your Octopus Server installation to the same Octopus version; you cannot move to an upgraded version.** Either upgrade your existing Octopus Server version, then move Octopus Server and files, or move and then upgrade on the new server. Please refer to our [upgrading guides](/docs/administration/upgrading) for information applicable to your scenario.

## Process

Below are instructions on how to move your Octopus Server and SQL Database.

1. Place your Octopus instance into [Maintenance Mode](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/maintenance-mode) and stop the service when all deployments have completed. You can stop the service via the Octopus Manager or the command line using the following command.
`Octopus.Server.exe service --stop`
2. Ensure you have saved a copy of your [Master Key](/docs/security/data-encryption#your-master-key).
3. Take a backup of your Octopus database.
4. Restore the database on your new server.
5. Create a new Octopus instance using the same Octopus version as your original instance. You can find an older version and download the MSI in our [previous releases](https://octopus.com/downloads/previous) page.
6. When installing your new instance, select the database you restored. It will prompt for the Master Key.
7. Copy the following directories from your original server to the new server (each of these folders are located in C:\Octopus in standard installations).
   - Task Logs
   - Packages
     - This folder only needs to be moved if using the built-in package repository. External feed details are stored in the database and will connect automatically.
   - Event Exports

:::div{.warning}
The database stores the locations for these directories. After you connect to the database, your settings will be the same as they were on your original server. You can change the locations for these directories, but we recommend first moving the directories to their original location and then pointing to the new location. This process is outlined in the [moving the home directory](/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/moving-your-octopus/move-the-home-directory) page.

8. Finally, if you have automatic package indexing enabled, restart your new Octopus instance to index the packages. You can restart Octopus Server with Octopus Manager or via the command line with the below command. If package indexing is disabled please trigger a manual update with the Sync Now button on your **Library âžœ Packages** page.
```
Octopus.Server.exe service --stop
Octopus.Server.exe service --start
```
