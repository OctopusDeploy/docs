It is generally safe to do an in-place upgrade from Octopus Deploy 4.x/2018.x to the latest version.  Please keep in mind, 4.x/2018.x did not include the Spaces feature. Spaces made the following changes:

- The majority of endpoints in the API can accept a `Space-Id`, for example `/api/Spaces-1/projects?skip=0&take=100` whereas before it was `/api/projects?skip=0&take=100`.  If a `Space-Id` isn't supplied, the default space is used.
- Teams can be assigned to multiple roles and spaces.  Before, a team could be assigned to only one role.
- Unique internal package feed per space.  Each space has a subfolder in the `Packages` directory to keep them segregated on the file system.  Before, a package would be located at `C:\Octopus\packages\MyPackage.2020.1.1.zip`.  Now it is `C:\Octopus\packages\Spaces-1\MyPackage.2020.1.1.zip`
- Almost every table in the database had a `Space-Id` column added to it.

The upgrade should work without error, but there are integration concerns to consider.  This guide will step through the steps to mitigate those concerns.

## Prep work

Before starting the upgrade, it is critical to back up the master key and license key.  If anything goes wrong, you might need these keys to do a restore.  It is better to have the backup and not need it than need the backup and not have it.  The master key doesn't change, while your license key changes, at most, once a year.  Back them up once to a secure location and move onto the next steps.

1. Backup the Master Key.
1. Backup the License Key.

## Standard upgrade process

The standard upgrade process is an in-place upgrade.  In-place upgrades update the binaries in the install directory and update the database.  The guide below includes additional steps to backup key components to make it easier to rollback in the unlikely event of a failure.

While an in-place upgrade will work, it involves risk as you are upgrading from a version released back in 2018.  Please see the risk mitigation sections below for steps on how to mitigate that risk.
:::

### Overview

The steps for this are:

1. Download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Enable maintenance mode.
1. Backup the database.
1. Do an in-place upgrade.
1. Test the upgraded instance.
1. Disable maintenance mode.

## Risk mitigation recommended approach - create a test instance

An in-place upgrade should be the safest approach.  Upgrade scripts assume you are upgrading from older versions of Octopus Deploy.  While the upgrade will work, there might be a new feature or breaking changes you will want to test first.  The recommended approach is to create a test instance containing a subset of projects representing your main instance.  Upgrade that test instance, verify it, and then upgrade the main instance.  

### Overview

The steps for this are:

1. Download the same version of Octopus Deploy as your main instance.
1. Install Octopus Deploy on a new VM.
1. Export a subset of projects from the main instance.
1. Import that subset of projects to the test instance.
1. Download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Backup the test instance database.
1. Upgrade that test instance to the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Test and verify the test instance.  
1. Enable maintenance mode on the main instance.
1. Backup the database on the main instance.
1. Backup all the folders on the main instance.
1. Do an in-place upgrade of your main instance.
1. Test upgraded main instance.
1. Disable maintenance mode.

## Risk mitigation alternative approach - create a cloned instance

An alternative approach to an in-place upgrade is to create a cloned instance and upgrade that.  From there, you can migrate over to the cloned instance or do an in-place upgrade of your existing instance and use the cloned instance for testing future upgrades.  

### Overview

Creating a clone of an existing instance involves:

1. Enable maintenance mode on the main instance.
1. Backup the database of the main instance.
1. Disable maintenance mode on the main instance.
1. Restore the backup of the main instance's database as a new database on the desired SQL Server.  
1. Download the same version of Octopus Deploy as your main instance.
1. Installing that version on a new server and configure it to point to the **cloned/restored** database.
1. Copying all the files from the backed up folders from the source instance.
1. Optional: Disable all deployment targets.
1. Upgrade cloned instance.
1. Test cloned instance.  Verify all API scripts, CI integrations, and deployments work.
1. If migrating, then migrate over.  Otherwise, leave the test instance alone, backup the folders and database, and upgrade the main instance.

## Rollback failed upgrade

While unlikely, an upgrade may fail.  It could fail on a database upgrade script, SQL Server version is no longer supported, license check validation, or plain old bad luck.  Depending on what failed, you have a decision to make.  If the cloned instance upgrade failed, it might make sense to start all over again.  Or, it might make sense to roll back to a previous version.  In either case, if you decide to roll back the process will be:

1. Restore the database backup.
1. Restore the folders.
1. Download and install the previously installed version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Do some sanity checks.
1. If maintenance mode is enabled, disable it.
