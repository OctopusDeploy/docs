There is always a risk an in-place upgrade will fail.  The risk increases as more versions have been released between upgrades.  We do our best to test many different configurations to put downward pressure on that risk. However, we can't cover every hyper-specific scenario.  Also, there might be a new feature, or a breaking change introduced.  Creating a test instance will help you reduce the risk for you and your company.

## Overview

There are two approaches to creating a test instance:

1. Subset of projects representing the main instance.
1. Clone of the main instance.

## Test instance with a subset of projects

Setting up a test instance with a subset of projects over a full clone has several advantages.  

- It is much easier to set up and configure than a clone.  It is also easy to automate the setting up and tearing down a test instance on demand.
- There is tooling in place to export specific projects.
- A clone does a full clone of everything, including deployment targets and triggers, increasing the risk of having the sandbox instance connect to production when the instance initially starts up.  You will need to disable all the targets to prevent this from happening.
- A clone might have hidden configuration options, such as server folders, that you have to change.

The disadvantage of a subset of projects over a full clone is that there could be significant drift between projects, and you might miss something.

The process to create an instance with a subset of projects is:

1. Download the same version of Octopus Deploy as your main instance.
1. Install Octopus Deploy on a new VM.
1. Export a subset of projects from the main instance.
1. Import that subset of projects to the test instance.
1. Download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Upgrade the test instance to the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Test and verify the test instance.

## Test instance is a clone

Setting up a test instance as a clone of the main instance has a few advantages over a subset of projects.

- Upgrades are much closer to a one to one comparison.
- You can do a full test of all integrations with Octopus Deploy.

Configuring a clone typically takes much more time and compute resources.  There are backup locations to consider, targets to disable, and more.  

Creating a clone of an existing instance involves:

1. Finding and backing up your Master Key.
1. Enabling maintenance mode on the main instance.
1. Backing up the database of the main instance.
1. Disabling maintenance mode on the main instance.
1. Restoring the backup of the main instance's database as a new database on the desired SQL Server.  
1. Downloading the same version of Octopus Deploy as your main instance.
1. Installing that version on a new server and configuring it to point to the cloned database.
1. Copying all the files from the backed up folders from the source instance.
1. *Optionally*, disabling targets on the cloned instance.
1. Download the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Upgrade the test instance to the latest version of Octopus Deploy.
1. Test and verify the test instance.
