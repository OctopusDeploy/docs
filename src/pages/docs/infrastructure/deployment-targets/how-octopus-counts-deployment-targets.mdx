Octopus Deploy counts deployment targets based on your license type. New customers and renewals will be on a PTM license. Previously, we offered a per-target license:
- PTM license (projects/tenants/machines) – Has a project limit with optional tenant and machine limits in the license key. Sold from Q4 2023 onward.
- Per target license - Only has a target limit, with no project or tenant limits in the license key. Sold between 2017 and 2024. From May 1, 2024, per target licenses are no longer available.

**Please note:** If you’re unsure of your license type, please refer to your invoice or contact [sales@octopus.com](mailto:sales@octopus.com).

| [Windows Server running a Tentacle](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/tentacle/windows)                | 1 machine per Tentacle instance     | 1 target per Tentacle instance     | Listening Tentacles registered multiple times on the same instance will count as one (1) target. |
| [Linux Server running a Tentacle](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/tentacle/linux)                    | 1 machine per Tentacle instance     | 1 target per Tentacle instance     | Listening Tentacles registered multiple times on the same instance will count as one (1) target. |
| [SSH Connection](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/linux/ssh-target)                                   | 1 machine per SSH Connection        | 1 target per SSH Connection        |      |
| [Kubernetes agent](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/kubernetes/kubernetes-agent)                      | 0 machines per Kubernetes Agent     | 1 target per Agent instance        |      |
| [Kubernetes Cluster](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/kubernetes-target)                              | 0 machines per Kubernetes Cluster   | 1 target per Kubernetes Namespace  | A namespace is required when registering the Kubernetes cluster with Octopus. By default, the namespace used in the registration is used in health checks and deployments. The namespace can be overwritten in the deployment process. |
| [AWS ECS Cluster](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/amazon-ecs-cluster-target)                         | 0 machines per ECS Cluster          | 1 target per ECS Cluster           |      |
| [Azure Web App / Function / Cloud Service](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/azure/web-app-targets)    | 0 machines per Web App / Function   | 1 target per Web App / Function    | This represents how Octopus _currently_ counts Azure Web Apps / Functions. However, one (1) Azure Web App / Function is not equal to one (1) Linux server. |
| [Azure Service Fabric Cluster](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/azure/service-fabric-cluster-targets) | 0 machines per cluster              | 1 target per cluster               |      |
| [Offline Package Drops](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/offline-package-drop)                        | 0 machines per offline package drop | 1 target per offline package drop  |      |
| [Cloud Region](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/cloud-regions)                                        | 0 machines per cloud region         | 0 target per cloud region          | Cloud regions are legacy targets that pre-dated workers as a mechanism to run scripts on cloud providers. They are used today to execute scripts multiple times with variables scoped for each iteration. |

**Please note:** Octopus only counts Windows servers, Linux servers, ECS clusters, Kubernetes clusters, etc., registered with an Octopus Deploy instance. If you have 5,000 Linux servers, and 4,000 are registered with Octopus, then Octopus only counts those 4,000 against your license.

## Adding deployment targets
You add deployment targets in different ways, depending on the type of target and how the target will communicate with the Octopus Server. For instructions, see:
