If you want to deploy software to Linux servers without using [SSH](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/linux/ssh-target), you need to install Tentacle, a lightweight agent service, on your Linux servers so they can communicate with the Octopus Server.

## Requirements

Before you can configure a Linux Tentacle, the Linux server must meet the [requirements](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/linux/#requirements) and the following additional requirements:

- Octopus Server **2019.8.3** or newer

Linux Tentacle is a .NET application distributed as a [self-contained deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained). On most Linux distributions it will *just work*, but be aware that there are [.NET Core prerequisites](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs/) that may need to be installed.

## Known limitations

Support for ScriptCS and F# scripts are only available with **Mono 4** and above. While they require mono installed, they will still execute with the self-contained Calamari.

ScriptCS has not been ported for .NET Core ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/1183)).

Similarly, the F# interpreter has also not yet been ported for .NET Core ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/2407)).

:::div{.warning}
ScriptCS does not work on Mono **5.16** and higher. We recommend using Mono **5.14.x**.

## Downloads

For Debian distributions, there is a .deb package for use with `apt-get`. On CentOS/Fedora/Red Hat distributions, there is an .rpm package for use with `yum`. We also provide a .tar.gz archive for manual installations. The packages are available from:

- apt.octopus.com
- rpm.octopus.com
- [Octopus Deploy downloads page](https://oc.to/ProductDownloadPage)

The latest release of Linux Tentacle is available for download from:

- [Archive](https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/Linux_x64TarGz/OctopusTentacle)
- [APT](https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/Linux_x64Apt/OctopusTentacle)
- [RPM](https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/Linux_x64Rpm/OctopusTentacle)

## Installing and configuring Linux Tentacle

:::div{.hint}
Many of the steps described below require elevated permissions, or must be run as a super user using `sudo`.
:::


### Installing Tentacle

<details data-group="deployment-targets-tentacle-linux">
<summary>Debian/Ubuntu repository</summary>

```bash
apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://apt.octopus.com/public.key

add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.octopus.com/ stretch main"
# for Raspbian use
# sh -c "echo 'deb https://apt.octopus.com/ buster main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"

apt-get update
apt-get install tentacle
```

</details>
<details data-group="deployment-targets-tentacle-linux">
<summary>Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora repository</summary>

```bash
wget https://rpm.octopus.com/tentacle.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/tentacle.repo
yum install tentacle -y
```

</details>
<details data-group="deployment-targets-tentacle-linux">
<summary>Archive</summary>

```bash
arch="x64"
# arch="arm" # for Raspbian 32-bit
# arch="arm64" # for 64-bit OS on ARM v7+ hardware

wget https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/Linux_$($arch)TarGz/OctopusTentacle -O tentacle-linux_$($arch).tar.gz
#or
curl -L https://octopus.com/downloads/latest/Linux_$($arch)TarGz/OctopusTentacle --output tentacle-linux_$($arch).tar.gz

mkdir /opt/octopus
tar xvzf tentacle-linux_$($arch).tar.gz -C /opt/octopus
```

</details>

### Setting up a Tentacle instance

Many instances of Tentacle can be configured on a single machine. To configure an instance run the following setup script:

```bash
/opt/octopus/tentacle/configure-tentacle.sh
```

Additional instances of Tentacle can be created and configured by passing the `--instance $instanceName` argument to all of the commands listed here.

:::div{.warning}
The installer script does not make any adjustments to firewalls. Be sure to check any ports specified are open on your firewalls. For example port `10933` for listening tentacles.
:::

## Running Tentacle

### Running Tentacle interactively

Start the Tentacle interactively by running:

```
/opt/octopus/tentacle/Tentacle run --instance <instance name>
```

### Running Tentacle as a service (syst/)

Tentacle has command line options for configuring a systemd service:

```
Usage: Tentacle service [<options>]

Where [<options>] is any of:

      --instance=VALUE       Name of the instance to use
      --start                Start the Tentacle service if it is not already
                               running
      --stop                 Stop the Tentacle service if it is running
      --reconfigure          Reconfigure the Tentacle service
      --install              Install the Tentacle service
      --username, --user=VALUE
                             Username to run the service under
                               (DOMAIN\Username format). Only used when --
                               install or --reconfigure are used.
      --uninstall            Uninstall the Tentacle service
      --password=VALUE       Password for the username specified with --
                               username. Only used when --install or --
                               reconfigure are used.
      --dependOn=VALUE

Or one of the common options:

      --help                 Show detailed help for this command
```

To install and start Tentacle as a service, use the `Tentacle service` command:

```
 /opt/octopus/tentacle/Tentacle service --install --start
```

### Manually configuring Tentacle to run as a service

To manually configure a systemd service, use the following sample unit file:

1. Create a systemd **Unit file** to run Tentacle.
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Octopus Tentacle Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   ExecStart=/opt/octopus/tentacle/Tentacle run --instance <instance name> --noninteractive
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Copy the unit file to `/etc/systemd/system` and give it permissions
   ```
   sudo cp tentacle.service /etc/systemd/system/tentacle.service
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/tentacle.service
   ```

3. Start the Tentacle service
   ```
   sudo systemctl start tentacle
   ```

4. Use the `enable` command to ensure that the service start whenever the system boots.
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable tentacle
   ```

## Automatic Tentacle upgrades

Linux Tentacle can be upgraded via the Octopus portal from the **Infrastructure âžœ Deployment Targets** screen. The upgrade attempts to find a package manager capable of performing the upgrade, and then falls back to extracting a `tar.gz` archive to the Tentacle installation folder.

The upgrade is attempted in the following order:

- Attempt to use `apt-get`
- Attempt to use `yum`
- Extract the bundled `tar.gz` archive

## Uninstall Tentacle

To uninstall (delete) a Tentacle instance run the `service --stop --uninstall` and then `delete-instance` commands first:

```
/opt/octopus/tentacle/Tentacle service --instance <instance name> --stop --uninstall
/opt/octopus/tentacle/Tentacle delete-instance --instance <instance name>
```

The `service --stop --uninstall` command on the Tentacle will run the following commands to manage the systemd **Unit file**:

```
sudo systemctl stop tentacle
sudo systemctl disable tentacle
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/tentacle.service
```

Then the working folders and logs can be deleted if they are no longer needed, depending on where you installed them, for instance:
```
# default locations:
# - installed directory:
cd /opt/octopus/tentacle

# - logs:
cd /etc/octopus

# - application directory:
cd /home/Octopus/Applications
```

## Automation scripts

The following bash scripts install, configure and register Linux Tentacle for use in automated environments:

:::div{.hint}
**Note:**
- Many of the steps described below require elevated permissions, or must be run as a super user using `sudo`.
- By default, when registering Linux Targets or Workers, the scripts below assume Octopus will communicate with the target or worker using the server hostname (from the `$HOSTNAME` variable). To provide a different address, consider looking up the hostname/IP address. For example:

      ```bash
      publicIp=$(curl -s https://ifconfig.info)
      ```
      You can specify the address when using the [register-with](/docs/octopus-rest-api/tentacle.exe-command-line/register-with) command by providing the value to the `--publicHostName` parameter.
