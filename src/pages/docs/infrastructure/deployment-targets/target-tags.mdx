Before you can deploy software to your deployment targets, you need to associate them with target tags. This ensures you deploy the right software to the right deployment targets. Typical target tags include:
- product-cluster
- web-server
- app-server
- db-server

Using target tags means the infrastructure in each of your environments doesn’t need to be identical and the deployment process will know which deployment targets to deploy your software to.

Deployment targets:
- Must have at least one tag
- Can have multiple tags
- Can share tags

## Add target tags \{#create-target-roles}
Target tags are created and saved in the database as soon as you assign them to a deployment target.

Decide on the naming convention you’ll use before creating your first target tag as you can’t change the case after the target tag has been created. For example, you can’t switch from all lowercase to camel case.

To create a target tag:
1. Register a deployment target or click on an already registered deployment target and go to Settings.
2. In the Target Tags field, enter the target tag you’d like to use (no spaces).
3. Save the target settings.

The target tag has been created and assigned to the deployment target and can be added to other deployment targets.

You can check all the target tags assigned to your deployment targets from the **Infrastructure** tab.

## Target tag sets \{#target-tag-sets}

:::div{.warning}
Target tag sets are supported from Octopus version **TODO**.
:::

Target tags are now organized into **target tag sets**, which are [tag sets](/docs/tenants/tag-sets) scoped to deployment targets. This gives you a structured way to group related target tags together, just as you can group tags for tenants, environments, projects, and runbooks.

### The [System] Tag Set \{#system-tag-set}

All existing target tags are automatically migrated into a built-in tag set called **[System] Tag Set**. This set is managed by Octopus and cannot be renamed or deleted.

### Custom target tag sets \{#custom-target-tag-sets}

In addition to the [System] Tag Set, you can create your own target tag sets to organize deployment targets by attributes relevant to your team. For example, you might create a tag set for cloud provider, region, or tier.

To create a custom target tag set:

1. Go to **Deploy ➜ Tag Sets** and click **Add Tag Set**.
2. Give the tag set a name and select **Target** as the scope.
3. Choose the tag set type:
   - **MultiSelect:** Allow multiple tags from this set to be assigned to a target.
   - **SingleSelect:** Allow only one tag from this set to be assigned to a target.
4. Add the tags you want to include in the set.
5. Save the tag set.

Each tag set appears as its own field in the deployment target settings, where you can assign tags from that set to a target.

Learn more about [tag sets](/docs/tenants/tag-sets), including tag set types, scopes, and how to create and manage them.

### API compatibility \{#api-compatibility}

The Octopus REST API represents target tags using a `roles` field on deployment target resources. This field continues to work as before — it returns and accepts the target tag values regardless of which tag set they belong to. No changes are required to existing API integrations.

## Older versions \{#older-versions}

- **Target roles** were renamed to **target tags** in Octopus Deploy 2024.2. The functionality was unchanged.
- **Target tags** were migrated to **target tag sets** (with a built-in [System] Tag Set) in Octopus version **TODO**. Existing target tags were moved automatically with no action required.
