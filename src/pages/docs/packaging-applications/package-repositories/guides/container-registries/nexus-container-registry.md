This guide will focus on adding a `Hosted` docker registry as an External Octopus Feed.

Give the repository a name and change any applicable configuration options.  When using HTTPS, a Nexus docker repository will listen on the specified port.

Click **Create repository** when you are done.

When the repository has been created, click on the entry in the list to bring up the repository properties.

Optionally push a container to the feed to make sure the feed works when added to Octopus Deploy.

## Adding an Nexus Docker repository as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `Docker Container Registry` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name, in the URL field, paste the URL to your Nexus server with the associated port. It should look similar to this format:

`https://your.nexus.url:[repository port]`
