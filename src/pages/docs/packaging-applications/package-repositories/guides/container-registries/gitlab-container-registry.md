GitLab creates a Container Registry for each Project or Group.  By default, container registries are disabled on self-hosted installations of GitLab.  To use the container registry, you must first enable it and assign a port for the registry to listen on.

## Adding a GitLab container registry as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `Docker Container Registry` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name and in the URL field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS URL of the GitLab server with the port the container registry listens on in the format:

`https://your.gitlab.url:[GitLab container registry port]`
