description: How to add an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Container Registry as an Octopus feed 
navOrder: 90

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a container registry that can be used as an external feed for Octopus Deploy.

## Create an OCI container registry
Once you've logged into OCI, search for `Container Registry` and select the **Container Registry** link located under `Services`.

Click on **Create repository**

Fill in the following:
- **Compartment**: Select which compartment to place the repository in
- **Repository name**: Give the repository a name
- **Access**: Select whether this will be a `Public` or `Private` repository

Click **Create repository**

Take note of which region you created the repository in as this will be needed to determine the correct URL for the repository.  Use the [Oracle region documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm) to lookup the **Region Key**.  In this example, the repository was created in `US West (San Jose)` which has the region key of `SJC`.

## Adding an OCI repository as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `Docker Container Registry` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name, in the URL field, paste the URL to your OCI region repository. It should look similar to this format:

`https://[region key].ocir.io`

Replace `[region key]` with the region key where your OCI container repository is located.
