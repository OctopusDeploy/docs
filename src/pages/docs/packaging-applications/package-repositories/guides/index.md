Octopus can consume package feeds from the [built-in repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/built-in-repository), and supports the following external repositories:

 - [Docker feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/docker-registries).
 - [GitHub feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/github-feeds).
 - [Maven feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/maven-feeds).
 - [NuGet feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/nuget-feeds).
 - Helm feeds.
 - AWS ECR feeds.
 
This section provides instructions on how to set-up a number of these external feeds from third-parties for use within Octopus.
