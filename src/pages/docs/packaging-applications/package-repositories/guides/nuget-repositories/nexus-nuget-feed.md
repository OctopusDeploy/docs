Copy the URL property, that is what you will use when adding it as an external feed

Optionally upload a NuGet package to the repository so you can verify search functionality when added as an external feed.

## Adding an Nexus NuGet repository as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `NuGet Feed` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name and in the URL field, paste the URL you copied earlier.  It should look similar to this format:

`https://your.nexus.url/repository/[repository name]`
