GitLab creates a NuGet Registry for each Project or Group.  To add the NuGet Registry to Octopus Deploy as an external feed, you will first need to get the Project or Group Id

## Adding a GitLab NuGet repository as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `NuGet Feed` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name and in the URL field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS URL of the feed for your GitLab Project or Group in the format:

Project:

`https://your.gitlab.url/api/v4/projects/[project id]/packages/nuget/index.json`

Group:

`https://your.gitlab.url/api/v4/groups/[group id]/-/packages/nuget/index.json`

Replace the URL from the examples above.
