ProGet from Inedo is an package repository technology which contains a number of different feed types.  This guide provides instructions on how to create a private container registry in ProGet and connect it to Octopus Deploy as an External Feed.

## Configuring a ProGet Registry

From the ProGet web portal, click on **Feeds ➜ Create New Feed**

Enter a name for your Feed, eg: ProGet-Docker, then click **Create Feed**

The next screen allows you to set optional features for your registry, configure these features or click **Close**.  Once the feed has been created, ProGet will display the `API endpoint URL` to push packages.  In this example it's `https://proget.octopusdemos.app/maven2/ProGet-Maven/`

## Adding a ProGet Maven as an Octopus External Feed

Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library ➜ External Feeds** and select the `Maven Feed` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name and in the URL field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS URL of the ProGet server:

`https://your.proget.url/maven2/feedname/`
