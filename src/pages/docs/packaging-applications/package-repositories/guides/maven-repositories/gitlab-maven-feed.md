GitLab creates a Maven Registry for each Project or Group.  To add the Maven Registry to Octopus Deploy as an external feed, you will first need to get the Project or Group Id

## Adding a GitLab Maven repository as an Octopus External Feed
Create a new Octopus Feed by navigating to **Library âžœ External Feeds** and select the `Maven Feed` Feed type. 

Give the feed a name and in the URL field, enter the HTTP/HTTPS URL of the feed for your GitLab Project or Group in the format:

Project:

`https://your.gitlab.url/api/v4/projects/[project id]/packages/packages/maven`

Group:

`https://your.gitlab.url/api/v4/groups/[group id]/-/packages/maven`

Replace the URL from the examples above.
