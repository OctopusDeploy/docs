Use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) to orchestrate Octopus from your CI pipeline for a seamless CI/CD workflow. 

Integrating GitHub Actions with Octopus Deploy allows you to trigger events in Octopus (like creating a Release) based on events in GitHub (like pushing to main) for an effortless transition from CI to CD.

## Octopus Deploy Actions

Octopus Deploy provides GitHub Actions which enable you to:
- [Log into Octopus Deploy](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/login-to-octopus-deploy)
- [Install Octopus CLI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-octopus-cli)
- [Create a Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-release-in-octopus-deploy)
- [Deploy a Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-a-release-in-octopus-deploy)
- [Deploy a Tenanted Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-a-tenanted-release-in-octopus-deploy)
- [Run a Runbook](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-runbook-in-octopus-deploy)
- [Push Build Information](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-build-information-to-octopus-deploy)
- [Create a Zip Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-zip-package-for-octopus-deploy)
- [Create a NuGet Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-nuget-package-for-octopus-deploy)
- [Push Packages to Octopus Deploy](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-package-to-octopus-deploy)
- [Wait for/ watch an Execution Task](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wait-watch-an-execution-task-in-octopus-deploy)

## Getting started

Octopus Deploy GitHub Actions can be easily incorporated into your own GitHub Action workflows by including them as steps in your workflow YAML. Here is a simple workflow YAML to get you started.

### Example workflow - Create and deploy a release
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hello-octopus-deploy.yml
name: Hello Octopus Deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  octopus-deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      id-token: write # Required by login action

    env:
      OCTOPUS_SPACE: 'Outer Space'
      # Supply the following values if not using the login action:
      # OCTOPUS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY  }}
      # OCTOPUS_URL: ${{ secrets.SERVER }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Your own build steps go here!
    - name: Your build ✨
      run: echo "Your build steps!"

    # Action to log into Octopus Deploy
    - name: Log into Octopus Deploy 🐙
      uses: OctopusDeploy/login@v1
      with: 
        server: https://acme.octopus.app 
        service_account_id: a1a1a1a1-b2b2-c3c3-d4d4-e5e5e5e5e5e5
    
    # Action to Create a Release
    - name: Create a release in Octopus Deploy 🐙
      uses: OctopusDeploy/create-release-action@v3
      with:
        project: 'MyProject'
        release_number: '1.0.0'
        git_ref: ${{ github.ref }}
        git_commit: ${{ github.sha }}
    
    # Action to Deploy a Release
    - name: Deploy a release in Octopus Deploy 🐙
      uses: OctopusDeploy/deploy-release-action@v3
      with:
        project: 'MyProject'
        release_number: '1.0.0'
        environments: |
            Dev
            Test
        variables: |
            Flip: Bling
            Fizz: Buzz
```

| `service_account_id`  | The id of the OIDC service account you wish to login as. Service accounts can be viewed and created on the Octopus app under 'Users' on the configuration menu. |


## Handling packages

To help you package your files for deployment, Octopus Deploy provides actions to [Create a Zip Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-zip-package-for-octopus-deploy) or [Create a NuGet Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-nuget-package-for-octopus-deploy). 

Alternatively, you can [Install the Octopus CLI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-octopus-cli) and create packages using the [pack command](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli/pack). 

Once your packages are created, simply push them to the Octopus Server built-in repository using our [Push Packages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-package-to-octopus-deploy) Octopus Action. 

You can confirm that your packages have been successfully added by checking for them in your Space under 'Packages'.

Here is a simple example of how to create, push and use a Zip package in a Release.

## Runners

Octopus Deploy GitHub Actions can be run on every available type of [runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#runners) (Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Self-Hosted). 

If your Octopus Server is not accessible over the internet, you can connect to it using a [Self-Hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).


## Sequencing tasks

It can be useful to run multiple Octopus Deploy GitHub Actions in sequence as part of a workflow. To do this, simply include each Octopus Action as a step within a single job. 

If you need to run sequential actions in separate jobs, you can also configure your jobs to run sequentially by [defining prerequisite jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-jobs-in-a-workflow#defining-prerequisite-jobs).


## Previous versions

Since the release of v3, Octopus Deploy GitHub Actions no longer need the [Install Octopus CLI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-octopus-cli) package to be installed before running. [Each Octopus Action](#octopus-deploy-actions) introduced before v3 provides a guide to migrating to v3.
