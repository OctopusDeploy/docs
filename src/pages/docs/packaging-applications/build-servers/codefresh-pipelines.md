Codefresh is a docker-native CI/CD platform

[Codefresh Pipelines](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/) are workflows that form Codefresh's continuous integration (CI) platform. 

# Integrating with Codefresh Pipelines
Codefresh pipelines allow you to customize steps to create, deploy and promote releases to your Octopus Deploy [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/). The steps do this by running the [Octopus CLI](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli) inside a docker container.

Octopus Deploy has several custom pipeline steps available: 

- [Login to Octopus](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Flogin)
- [Create a package](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fcreate-package)
- [Push a package](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fpush-package)
- [Create a release](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fcreate-release)
- [Deploy a release](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fdeploy-release)
- [Deploy a tenanted release](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fdeploy-release-tenanted)
- [Await Task](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fawait-task)
- [Run a Runbook](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Frun-runbook)
- [Push Build Information](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/octopusdeploy%2Fpush-build-information)


## Codefresh Pipeline step configuration

When creating your first Codefresh Pipeline, the pipeline workflow can be defined in the codefresh UI or within a git-based repository. The workflow yaml defines the steps to run and any arguments required to run each step. 

The details of an Octopus instance are required to run all Octopus Codefresh steps:

| Variable name       | Description|
| ------------- | ------- |
| `OCTOPUS_URL` | The Octopus Server URL you wish to run your steps on |
| `OCTOPUS_API_KEY` | The Octopus Deploy API Key required for authentication |
| `OCTOPUS_SPACE` | The Space to run steps on |

## Codefresh variables 

It is recommended to use codefresh variables to set the `OCTOPUS_URL` and an encrypted variable to set the `OCTOPUS_API_KEY`. This way, you can simply insert the variable for all octopus deploy steps in your workflow.

These can be set by clicking **Add Variable** from the **Variable** menu of your Codefresh Pipeline.

Enter your variable name and value. To insert the variable in your workflow, use the codefresh variable syntax `${{YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME}}`

:::

For more details on codefresh pipeline variables, see the Codefresh documentation on [Variables in pipelines](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/variables/).

## Codefresh encrypted variables

To store sensitive information such as Octopus Deploy API keys, you can use Codefresh's encrypted variables in your workflow. To encrypt the variable, click on the lock next to the variable value.

## Triggering a build

A build can be triggered in a few different ways such as:
- Push commits
- Pull requests 
- On-demand

And others depending on your git provider. Please see the [Codefresh documentation on supported git trigger events](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/triggers/git-triggers/).

For details on how to configure git triggers, see the [Codefresh documentation on Git Triggers](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/triggers/git-triggers/).


# Codefresh Pipeline stages

Codefresh Pipelines are workflows that consist of ***steps***. By default, the Codefresh execution engine will execute sequentially from the first defined step in the `codefresh.yml` file. To [configure parallel steps in your pipeline](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/advanced-workflows/), see the Codefresh documentation for more details. 

Before defining the steps in your workflow, you can configure in ***stages***. You can then assign a stage for each of the steps in your pipeline. Stages are groups used to define how the steps will be visualized in the UI, and have no effect on the execution of the steps.

```yaml
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "Deploy project"
  - "Run the runbook"

steps:
  create-release:
    type: octopusdeploy/create-release
    stage: "Deploy project"
    arguments:
      ...

  deploy:
    type: octopusdeploy/deploy-release
    stage: "Deploy project"
    arguments:
      ...

  run-runbook:
    type: octopusdeploy/run-runbook
    stage: "Run the runbook"
    arguments:
      ...
```

#### Example Pipeline build

The following example demonstrates a Codefresh Pipeline build of our example application, [OctoPetShop](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/OctoPetShop).  This application is written in .NET Core and consists of four components:

- OctopusSamples.OctoPetShop.Database - Database updates using DBUp
- OctopusSamples.OctoPetShop.Web - Web front end
- OctopusSamples.OctoPetShop.ProductService - Product service API
- OctopusSamples.OctoPetShop.ShoppingCartService - Shopping cart service API

To build this application, you'll need the following steps:

- Checkout the source code
- Clone the source code

Below is an example Codefresh Pipeline workflow which includes these steps:


```yaml
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "Deploy project"
  - "Run the runbook"

steps:
  create-release:
    type: octopusdeploy/create-release
    stage: "Deploy project"
    arguments:
      OCTOPUS_API_KEY: <<YOUR_API_KEY>>
      OCTOPUS_URL: "https://example.octopustest.app/"
      OCTOPUS_SPACE: "Spaces-1"
      PROJECT: "Create Release Test"
      RELEASE_NUMBER: "1.0.2"
      PACKAGES:
       - "Hello:1.0.0"
      RELEASE_NOTES: This is a release note

  deploy:
    type: octopusdeploy/deploy-release
    stage: "Deploy project"
    arguments:
      OCTOPUS_API_KEY: <<YOUR_API_KEY>>
      OCTOPUS_URL: "https://example.octopustest.app/"
      OCTOPUS_SPACE: "Spaces-1"
      PROJECT: "Create Release Test"
      RELEASE_NUMBER: "1.0.2"
      ENVIRONMENTS:
        - "Development"
```

# Octopus Deploy steps

Octopus Deploy steps and examples are available from the [Codefresh Marketplace](https://codefresh.io/steps/).

Each step includes one or two examples to help with setting up a workflow. Basic examples include only required arguments, and complex examples include both required and optional arguments.

## Create a release

To create a release, use the **octopusdeploy/create-release** step. Provide the details for your Octopus instance, and the project you would like to create a release for:

```yaml
create-release:
  type: octopusdeploy/create-release
  arguments:
    OCTOPUS_API_KEY: '${{OCTOPUS_API_KEY}}'
    OCTOPUS_URL: '${{OCTOPUS_URL}}'
    OCTOPUS_SPACE: "Default"
    PROJECT: "Project Name"
```

Optional arguments help to customize the creation of the release. You can specify version control details, select packages and provide release notes:

```yaml
create-release:
  type: octopusdeploy/create-release
  arguments:
    OCTOPUS_API_KEY: '${{OCTOPUS_API_KEY}}'
    OCTOPUS_URL: '${{OCTOPUS_URL}}'
    OCTOPUS_SPACE: "Default"
    PROJECT: "Project Name"
    RELEASE_NUMBER: "1.0.0-hotfix1"
    CHANNEL: "Hotfix"
    GIT_REF: "refs/heads/main"
    PACKAGES:
      - "Sample:1.0.0-hotfix1"
    RELEASE_NOTES: This is a release note
```

## Run a runbook

To run a runbook, use the `octopusdeploy/run-runbook` step. Provide the name of the runbook that you want to run, as well as the project and environment name(s).

```yaml
run-runbook:
  type: octopusdeploy/run-runbook
  arguments:
    OCTOPUS_API_KEY: '${{OCTOPUS_API_KEY}}'
    OCTOPUS_URL: '${{OCTOPUS_URL}}'
    OCTOPUS_SPACE: Spaces 1
    PROJECT: Project Name
    NAME: Runbook Name
    ENVIRONMENTS:
      - Development
      - Production
```

Optional arguments include variables to use within the runbook, the option to run for specific tenants or tenant tags, as well as the option to use guided failure mode.

```yaml
run-runbook:
  type: octopusdeploy/run-runbook
  arguments:
    OCTOPUS_API_KEY: '${{OCTOPUS_API_KEY}}'
    OCTOPUS_URL: '${{OCTOPUS_URL}}'
    OCTOPUS_SPACE: Spaces 1
    PROJECT: Project Name
    NAME: Runbook Name
    ENVIRONMENTS:
      - Development
      - Production
    VARIABLES:
      - 'Label:Value'
    TENANTS:
      - Tenant 1
    TENANT_TAGS:
      - Tenant tag 1
    USE_GUIDED_FAILURE: 'false'

```

## Push build information

To push build information for a project, use the `octopusdeploy/push-build-information` step. Provide a list of packages that need build information, a build information json file and a version number. 

By default, the step will fail if build information already exists, but this can be configured using the `OVERWRITE_MODE` option ('fail', 'overwrite', or 'ignore').

```yaml
push-build-information:
  type: octopusdeploy/push-build-information
  arguments:
    OCTOPUS_API_KEY: '${{OCTOPUS_API_KEY}}'
    OCTOPUS_URL: '${{OCTOPUS_URL}}'
    OCTOPUS_SPACE: Spaces 1
    PACKAGE_IDS:
      - SomePackage
      - SomeOtherPackage
    FILE: SomeFile.json
    VERSION: 1.0.0
    OVERWRITE_MODE: fail
```

Sample build information json file:

```json
{
  "BuildEnvironment": "BitBucket",
  "Branch": "main",
  "BuildNumber": "288",
  "BuildUrl": "https://bitbucket.org/octopussamples/petclinic/addon/pipelines/home#!/results/288",
  "VcsType": "Git",
  "VcsRoot": "http://bitbucket.org/octopussamples/petclinic",
  "VcsCommitNumber": "12345",
  "Commits":
  [
    {
      "Id": "12345",
      "Comment": "Sample commit message"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Error handling

Codefresh provides inbuilt error handling for all steps. Retry of failed steps is enabled using the `retry` settings.  See the [Codefresh documentation on retrying a step](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/#retrying-a-step) for more details.

```yaml
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "Deploy project"

steps:
  deploy:
    type: octopusdeploy/deploy-release
    stage: "Deploy project"
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 5
      delay: 5
      exponentialFactor: 2
    arguments:
      OCTOPUS_API_KEY: <<YOUR_API_KEY>>
      OCTOPUS_URL: "https://example.octopustest.app/"
      OCTOPUS_SPACE: "Spaces-1"
      PROJECT: "Create Release Test"
      RELEASE_NUMBER: "1.0.2"
      ENVIRONMENTS:
        - "Development"
```
