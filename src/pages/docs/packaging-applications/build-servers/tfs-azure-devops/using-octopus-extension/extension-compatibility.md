## Octopus extension versions

There have been four major versions of the Octopus Extension:

- [**Version 1.2.x**](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/octopus-downloads/tfs-2015-extension/octopusdeploy.octopus-deploy-build-release-tasks-1.2.28.vsix) - obsolete, but still usable for older versions of TFS and Azure DevOps
- [**Version 2.0.199**](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/octopus-downloads/tfs-2015-extension/octopusdeploy.octopus-deploy-build-release-tasks-2.0.199.vsix) - for TFS 2015 Update 2, TFS 2015 Update 3, TFS 2015 Update 4, and TFS 2017 RTM
- [**Version 3**](https://octopus-downloads.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tfs-2015-extension/octopusdeploy.octopus-deploy-build-release-tasks-3.0.222.vsix) - download for TFS 2017 Update 1
- [**Current Version**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octopusdeploy.octopus-deploy-build-release-tasks) - the current, most recent version of the extension, for Azure DevOps

## Extension compatibility with Azure DevOps/Team Foundation Server

The following table shows compatibility between versions of Azure DevOps, TFS, and the Octopus extension

| Azure DevOps/TFS Version / Extension Version |   1.2.x   |   2.0.199     |     3     |     4 and 5     | 6 |
| -------------------------------------------- |:---------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| Azure DevOps                                 | Supported | Not supported |   Supported   |   Supported   |   Supported   |
| TFS 2017 Update 3                            | Supported |   Supported   |   Supported   |   Supported   | Not supported |
| TFS 2017 Update 2                            | Supported |   Supported   |   Supported   |   Supported   | Not supported |
| TFS 2017 Update 1                            | Supported |   Supported   |   Supported   | Not supported | Not supported |
| TFS 2017 RTM                                 | Supported |   Supported   | Not supported | Not supported | Not supported |
| TFS 2015 Updates 2,3,4                       | Supported |   Supported   | Not supported | Not supported | Not supported |

TFS 2017 Update 1 is technically supported with version 2.0.199 of the extension, but we do not recommended it.

Any version older than TFS 2015 Update 2 is not supported by any extension version.

### Build information compatibility {#build-information-compatibility}

When passing [build information](/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/build-information) to Octopus from Azure DevOps, you may encounter issues when trying to use the build link generated by the Azure DevOps extension.

Specifically, the build link may return a `404 (Not Found)` error when viewed. The cause for the issue is believed to be the result of a change to the format of the build URL supported by Azure DevOps.

The Build information step in the Octopus Azure DevOps extension expects the build to be viewed using a URL like this: 
`https://my-tfs-server-address/tfs/Projects/MyProject/_build/results?buildId=<BUILDID>`.

However, affected TFS versions expect the build to be viewed using a different URL like this: `https://my-tfs-server-address/tfs/Projects/MyProject/_build/index?buildId=<BUILDID>`.

Since the Build information step was created after this change, the only workarounds are to either try to create a URL re-write rule in TFS to display the build using the new URL format, or to update the TFS version.
