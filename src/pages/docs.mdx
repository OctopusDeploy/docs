Octopus Deploy is a sophisticated, best-of-breed continuous delivery (CD) platform for modern software teams. Octopus provides powerful release orchestration, deployment automation, and day 2 runbook automation, while handling the scale, complexity and governance expectations of even the largest organizations with the most complex deployment challenges.

Octopus is simple to get started with - you can go from zero to fully automating your deployments in minutes. Octopus provides a modern, friendly user experience that makes it easy for your teams to self-service application releases, and democratizes how you deliver software. Octopus also has a comprehensive API - anything the UI can do, the API can do too. 

Octopus models the entire release orchestration process of software. This includes environment promotion (beyond simple **dev**/**test**/**prod** workflows), deployment automation, progressive software delivery (rolling deployments, blue/green, canary), configuration management, approvals & ITSM integration, deployment freezes, and more. Advanced role-based access control ensures only the right people can deploy to production, all changes are audited, and teams can get their work done without proliferation of admin access to cloud accounts or privelleged systems. 

Octopus can be used to deploy just about anything, anywhere. Whether it’s **Kubernetes**, **Linux** or **Windows** virtual machines, **Amazon Web Services**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud**, so long as Octopus can speak to it via our advanced Tentacle agent, SSH, command line, or a web service, Octopus can handle it. 

Octopus can be self-managed and hosted in your own infrastructure or private cloud, or we can host it for you in Octopus Cloud. 

Built by experienced DevOps practitioners over a decade, and battle tested by thousands of organizations ranging from small teams to large Fortune 100 organizations with tens of thousands of engineers, projects and deployment targets, Octopus embodies a set of principles about what we’ve learned in doing CD well:

- CI is not CD
- Build your binaries/containers once
- Consistency across processes, teams and environments
- Pragmatic use of version control and GitOps

Octopus models deployments in advanced ways that allows you to tame complexity at scale. For example, if “deploying to production” means a co-ordinated rollout of applications and dependencies across geographically distributed clusters in the cloud on behalf of thousands of end-customers, each with their own instances of your application, or pushing releases out to edge networks or servers running in physical retail stores, hospitals or hotels, Octopus enables you to model this in ways no other CD tool can using **tenanted deployments**.  

### Why do I need Octopus when I already have a CI/CD tool?

On most teams, continuous integration (CI) or build automation is a solved problem. Great options like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, TeamCity, BuildKite, and Azure DevOps exist and are widely used by teams today. 

These systems are all designed in a similar way - they monitor source code repositories for changes, compile code, run unit tests, and give software developers fast feedback on their code changes. Some of them in their marketing will also say they do CD. Technically this is true, but it usually means they provide some ability to call a deployment script that you provide - the deployment script is up to you. They might also provide some way to model simple dev/test/production promotion workflows by calling a different deployment script for each environment. 

When a software team is starting out, this “put your deployment script here” approach to CD can work - the deployment script starts simple. Over time as applications evolve, complexity grows. That “deployment script” becomes hundreds and thousands of lines of specialized scripts and YAML that at best only a couple of people on the team understand or are comfortable changing. Multiply that over many teams and applications at the company and “DIY shadow CD” is born. Teams of engineers become dedicated to building custom CD glue to bridge the gap between “put your deployment script here” and the realities of the complexity of delivering software at scale.

Octopus was designed around these observations:

- Build/test automation is the simpler part of CI/CD, and is generally solved in most teams. CI systems compile code, run tests, and produce an artifact (e.g., container or package). Plenty of great solutions already exist, and the build process only evolves very gradually over time.
- Release & deployment automation, as well as “day 2” operations automation, is the much more challenging part of CI/CD. It’s where teams struggle the most, where all the auditing and compliance requirements of enterprises come into play, and where complexity grows and grows quickly over time.

Decoupling the CI platform from the CD platform allows teams to bring their favorite CI tool - and most organizations have more than one - while we focus on giving you the most powerful best-of-breed CD capabilities. Octopus integrates with popular CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins or TeamCity, letting them do what they do best - the CI part of the feedback loop. Octopus then takes over “artifact-forward”, and handles the release and deployment aspects of CD in advanced ways that no CI/CD tool can. 

We promise that when using Octopus, compared to a generic CI/CD tool, you’ll spend 1/10th the amount of time building DIY shadow CD glue, and more time shipping new features and delivering valuable software to production.
